<h2><a name="THE_HISTORICAL_ELEMENT_IN_RECENT_SOUTHERN" id="THE_HISTORICAL_ELEMENT_IN_RECENT_SOUTHERN">THE HISTORICAL ELEMENT IN RECENT SOUTHERN
LITERATURE.</a><br />

BY C. ALPHONSO SMITH, A. M., PH. D.</h2>


<p>The year 1870 marks an epoch in the history of the South.
It witnessed not only the death of Robert E. Lee but the passing
also of John Pendleton Kennedy, George Denison Prentice, Augustus
Baldwin Longstreet, and William Gilmore Simms. In
literature it was not only the end of the old but the beginning of
the new, for in 1870 the new movement in Southern literature
may be said to have been inaugurated in the work of Irwin Russell.
I have attempted elsewhere to trace briefly the chronological
outlines of this literature from 1870 to the present time. In
this paper, therefore, I shall discuss not the history of this literature
but rather the history in this literature.</p>

<p>When we compare Southern literature of ante-bellum days
with that produced since 1870 we note at once certain obvious
differences of style and structure. In the older literature the
sentences are longer, the paragraphs less coherent, adjectives
more abundant, descriptions more elaborate, plots more intricate
and fanciful. In the newer literature the pen is held more
firmly; there are fewer episodes; incidents are chosen to illustrate
character rather than to enhance the plot; the language is
more temperate; the pathos and humor more subtle; some fixed
goal is kept in view and the action of the story converges steadily
toward this end.</p>

<p>But apart from these stylistic and structural differences
there are differences that appeal to the student of history equally
as much as to the student of pure literature. Since 1870 Southern
writers have begun to find their topics and their inspiration
in the life that is round about them. They are resorting not so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
much to books as to memory, observation and experience. They
are not rising into solitary and selfish renown; they are lifting
the South with them. They are writing Southern history because
they are describing Southern life. The writings of Irwin Russell,
Sidney Lanier, Joel Chandler Harris, Miss Murfree, George W.
Cable, Thomas Nelson Page, James Lane Allen, Miss Grace King,
Mrs. Ruth McEnery Stuart, and John Fox, Jr., are spreading a
knowledge of Southern life and Southern conditions where such
knowledge has never penetrated before. And though we call this
literature Southern, it is neither sectional in its appeal nor
provincial in its workmanship. This, then, is what I mean by the
historical element in recent Southern literature.</p>

<p>It has long seemed to me that much of the immediate influence
of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> both in this country and in England
was due to the fact that the South could not show in all of
its ante-bellum literature a single novel treating the same themes
treated by Mrs. Stowe, but treating them from a different point
of view. It was the first attempt to portray in vivid colors the
social and institutional conditions of the South. None of our
writers had utilized the material that lay ready to their hands.
There was no story written in the spirit of <i>Marse Chan</i> or <i>Uncle
Remus</i> which the South could hold up and say,</p>

<p>"Look here, upon this picture, and on this."</p>

<p>The reception accorded Mrs. Stowe's book in the South
teaches a valuable lesson, and a lesson which Southern writers
have for thirty years profited by <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> was met
by bitter criticism, by argument, by denunciation, by denial, or
by contemptuous silence. But the appeal made by a literary masterpiece,
however deficient or faulty in its premises, is not thus
to be negatived. The true answer to <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> and the
most adequate answer that could be given is to be found in the
historical note that characterizes the work of Irwin Russell and
those who have succeeded him.</p>

<p>I wish to state, therefore, in somewhat broader terms than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
I have yet seen it stated, what seems to me the historical importance
of Irwin Russell in American literature. His priority in
the fictional use of the negro dialect has been frequently emphasized,
but I wish to emphasize his priority in utilizing for
literary purposes the social and institutional conditions in which
he himself had lived. Skill in the use of a dialect is a purely literary
excellence, but when a writer portrays and thus perpetuates
the peculiar life of a people numbering four million, he is
to that extent an historian; and Irwin Russell's example in this
respect meant a complete change of front in Southern literature.
He did not go to Italy for his inspiration as Richard Henry
Wilde had done. You find no <i>Rodolph</i>, or <i>Hymns to the Gods</i>, or
<i>Voyage to the Moon</i> among his writings; but you will find that
deeper poetic vision that saw pathos and humor and beauty in
the humble life that others had contemned.</p>

<p>The appearance of <i>Christmas-Night in the Quarters</i> meant
that Southern literature was now to become a true reproduction
of Southern conditions. Our writers were henceforth to busy
themselves with the interpretation of life at close range. They
were to produce a kaleidoscopic body of fiction, each bit of which,
sparkling with its own characteristic and independent color,
should yet contribute its part to the harmony and symmetry of
the whole.</p>

<p>I would not for a moment compare the genius of Irwin
Russell with that of Chaucer or of Burns; and yet when Chaucer
in the latter part of his life turned from French and Italian
sources to find an ampler inspiration in his own England, the
England that he knew and loved, he was but illustrating the
change that Irwin Russell was to inaugurate in Southern literature;
and when Robert Burns broke through the classical trammels
of the eighteenth century and lifted the poor Scotch cotter
into the circle of the immortals, he was but anticipating your
own Mississippian in proving that poetry, like charity, begins
at home. To the student of literature, there is a wide difference
between the <i>Prologue to the Canterbury Tales</i>, <i>The Cotter's Saturday
Night</i>, and the <i>Christmas-Night in the Quarters</i>; but to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the student of history the poems stand upon the same plane because
each is a transcript of contemporary life.</p>

<p>Irwin Russell represents, therefore, a transition of vital
significance in our literature, a transition that had been partly
foretold in the work of Judge Longstreet and Col. Richard Malcolm
Johnston. There is as much local coloring in the <i>Georgia
Scenes</i> and the <i>Dukesborough Tales</i> as in the work of Irwin
Russell; but I do not find the same deft workmanship; I miss in
the older works the sympathy, the pathos, and the self-restraint
that enable Irwin Russel to be local in his themes without being
provincial in his manner.</p>

<p>I do not say that the poet or the novelist must never revert
to past history or to historical documents for his topics. His own
genius and taste must be his surest guide to both as to topic and
to treatment; but I do say that a nation is unfortunate if the
builders of its literature invariably draw their material from
foreign sources or from the history that was enacted before they
were born.</p>

<p>"I have no churlish objection," says Emerson in his <i>Essay
on Self-Reliance</i>, "to the circumnavigation of the globe for the
purposes of art, of study and benevolence, so that the man is
first domesticated, or does not go abroad with the hope of finding
somewhat greater than he knows____ The soul created the arts
wherever they have flourished. It was in his own mind that the
artist sought his model. And why need we copy the Doric or the
Gothic model? Beauty, convenience, grandeur of thought, and
quaint expression are as near to us as to any, and if the American
artist will study with hope and love the precise thing to be done
by him, considering the climate, the soil, the length of the day,
the wants of the people, ... he will create a house in which all
these will find themselves fitted, and taste and sentiment will be
satisfied also."</p>

<p>The historical element, therefore, of which I am speaking
is not synonymous with the historical novel. The critics apply the
term historical novel to those novels that attempt to reproduce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the past. These novels are retrospective and essentially romantic.
In the work of Sir Walter Scott this form of literature attained
its florescence. But I contend that while the historical novel may
have a genuinely human interest, its value as history is almost
inappreciable as compared with the historical value of the literature
that portrays contemporary life. We do not study ancient
history in Chaucer's <i>Legend of Good Women</i>, but there would
be a deplorable gap in our knowledge of fourteenth century England
if <i>The Prologue to the Canterbury Tales</i> had never been
written.</p>

<p>A hundred years from now Dickens' <i>Tale of Two Cities</i>
will not have the historical significance that <i>David Copperfield</i>
will have; because the <i>Tale of Two Cities</i> is based on records
that are accessible to all students of the French Revolution. It
is not an interpretation of life at first hand; it is an interpretation
only of books. Then, too, historical investigation is even
today far more accurate and scientific than when Dickens wrote.
But <i>David Copperfield</i>, which the critics have never called an
historical novel, has an historical element that time cannot take
away, for it is the record of what an accurate observer saw and
felt and heard in the first half of the nineteenth century. The historical
novel, therefore, in the current acceptation of the term,
contributes nothing to the sources of historical study, though it
does popularize history and thus help to prepare an audience for
the scientific historian.</p>

<p>Now, the South has produced her full share of historical
novels. From <i>Horse-Shoe Robinson</i> in 1835 to <i>The Prisoners of
Hope</i> in 1898, Southern writers have shown themselves by no
means insensible to the literary possibilities latent in our colonial
and revolutionary history. But it was not until 1870 that the
South may be said to have had a school of writers who, while not
neglecting the historical novel proper, began to find the scenery
and materials of their stories chiefly in local conditions and in
passing or remembered events. Much, it is true, has been lost to
our literature, but much has been saved.</p>

<p>It has often been said that the new movement in Southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
literature was due to the influence of Bret Harte's works, but
such a statement hardly deserves refutation. The cause lies deeper
than this. The events of 1861-65 not only broke the continuity
of Southern history but changed forever the social and political
status of the Southern states. The past began to loom up strange
and remote, but "dear as remembered kisses after death." Men
seemed to have lived a quarter of a century in four years. They
moved as in a world not realized. Now it is just at such periods
that literature finds its opportunity, for at such periods a people's
historic consciousness is either deepened or destroyed, and
this national consciousness finds expression in historical literature.</p>

<p>The South, then, is slowly writing her history in her literature.
Hardly a year passes that some new state or some new
period does not find a place in the onward movement. Only in
the last year, hundreds of readers who care nothing for formal
histories have pored over Mr. Page's <i>Red Rock</i> and learned for
the first time the inside history of Reconstruction; in the pages of
Miss Murfree's <i>Story of Old Fort Loudon</i>, they have seen the
heroism with which the Tennessee soldier won his state from the
wilderness and the Indian; in Miss Grace King's <i>De Soto and
his Men in the Land of Florida</i>, they have followed the discoverer
of the Mississippi on a journey as marvelous and romantic
as the fabled voyage of Jason; in <i>The Kentuckians</i> of John Fox,
Jr., they have read again of that undying feud between highlander
and lowlander that has found expression in more than a hundred
English and Scotch ballads; in <i>Chalmette</i> of Mr. Clinton
Ross, they have stood again with Jackson on an immortal battlefield;
in <i>The Wire Cutters</i> of Mrs. M. E. M. Davis, they have
witnessed a hitherto unexplored region, that of West Texas,
added to the growing map of Southern literature; in <i>The Prisoners
of Hope</i>, by Miss Mary Johnston, they have heard the first
mutterings of insurrection under the colonial tyranny of Governor
Berkeley,&mdash;mutterings that a century later were to be reinforced
by the pen of Jefferson and the sword of Washington.
And these books mark the record of but twelve months.</p>

<p>Need I say that the significance of this historical movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
in our literature is vital and profound for every man and woman
before me? or that it merits the earnest consideration of every
historical society organized to preserve and perpetuate the facts
of our history.</p>

<p>Let me remind you that the literary significance of the Civil
War is as noteworthy as its purely historical significance. That
struggle meant far more to the South than to the North. To
the North it meant the preservation of the Union and the abolition
of slavery. To the South it meant decimated families,
smoking homesteads, and the passing forever of a civilization
unique in human history. But <span class="smcap">Literature loves a lost cause,
provided honor be not lost</span>. Hector, the leader of the vanquished
Trojans, is the most princely figure that the Greek
Homer has portrayed; the Roman Virgil is proud to trace the
lineage of his people not back to the victorious Greeks but to the
defeated Trojans; the English poet-laureate finds his deepest inspiration
not in the victories of his Saxon ancestors over King
Arthur but in King Arthur himself, the fated leader of a losing
cause. And so it has always been: the brave but unfortunate
reap always the richest measure of literary immortality.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I believe that in the organization of the Mississippi
State Historical Society and in the beneficent work that
it has wrought during its career of nine years, I see another indication
of that growing historic consciousness without which we
cannot stand unabashed before the bar of future history. "Deeds
of prowess and exalted situations cannot of themselves" says
Schlegel (<i>History of Literature</i>, Lecture I) "command our admiration
or determine our judgment. A people that would rank
high in our esteem must themselves be conscious of the importance
of their own doings and fortunes." The invaluable work
that is being done by this Society for the history of Mississippi is
a part of that larger movement of which I have spoken. Both
testify to the advent of that historical spirit which "cannot be
gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
thereof." If I read aright the signs of the times, the new
century will not have been many years old before the history of
the South will be enshrined not only in annals and chronicles but
in the living letters of a nation's song and story.</p>

BY W. L. WEBER.</h2>


<p>So wide is the connotation of the word Romanticism, we may
make up almost any conceivable definition and be sure we have
respectable authority in agreement with the view we have taken.
The fault to be found with the current definitions is that they
stress the source, at the expense, of the character of that influence
which transformed "the age of prose and reason" into the
"Renascence of Wonder." The influence to be stressed in the
use I shall wish to make of the word Romanticism is protest
against the settled, conservative, classical order of things. Secondarily,
it will be remembered that the source of much of the
literary material used by the protestants is to be found in the remote
past&mdash;remote whether in time or in charge of mental attitude.</p>

<p>In order to be able to throw a clearly defined portrait of
Irwin Russell on the canvas of Southern literature, it will be
necessary rapidly to review the main outlines of this Romantic
movement in the development of English thought a period which
may be shown to be the prototype of our own after-the-war literary
life.</p>

<p>We shall not go into details. First we should recall to mind
the main literary currents of English thinking from the time of
Dryden to the end of the dictatorship of the great Cham himself.
It will be readily remembered that fashion in literature
had changed soon after Shakespeare's death and his native wood-notes
wild were forgot for a time. The age of prose and reason
followed. Self-consciousness was a characteristic note of the
Augustan, the eighteenth century literature. Narrowness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
imagination, and faithfulness in copying made up the main
classical elements in many an English poet under the regime of
Formalism.</p>

<p>"Back to nature!" was the rallying cry of a protest against
this formalism&mdash;an inarticulate protest which culminated in the
Romantic movement. Under the leadership of Dryden and for
more than a century after him, canons of literary art based on
classical models had almost undisputed sway. Aristotle filtered
through Horace and Horace diluted by Boileau were prescribed
by doctors who would correct and amend English speech and
literature. From these masters were drawn rules so minute and
so inflexible as to put to the death budding originality by the
demand for "correctness." If the poet were moved to describe
pastoral scenes, he must needs go to Theocritus for the
names of his characters, to Virgil for the contour of his scenery.
But all this classicism was counterfeit. It was "more Latin
than Greek, and more French than Latin." The classical poet,
as he misnamed himself, followed with slavish persistence the
creed which he had adopted. It was an accepted law that "the
best of the modern poets in all languages are those that have the
nearest copied the ancients." He would have nothing of country
life. Rough and irregular scenery were distasteful to him.
Mountains he described by Gothic&mdash;his pet term of opprobrium.
Scenery as well as thought must conform to the level. "Decent
conformity," then, characterized the Augustan age and enthusiasm
had no place in the age of Dryden and of Pope.</p>

<p>Some of the characteristic features of the Romantic movement
may be readily got at, by prefixing a negative to the qualities
of the classical school. The country, out door life, rugged
mountains, folk-songs, ballads in every form, the picturing of
English people in English scenery were used as subject-matter&mdash;in
other words, the telling what the writer had himself seen
and, therefore, what he really knew, instead of what he had read.
It was this reaction against formalism which produced such men
as Chatterton, Burns, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Byron, Scott.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not within the purpose of this paper to give a full list
of the writers who may be said to be the forerunners of this
movement which dominated English poetry during the first quarter
of the Nineteenth Century. Nor is it needful to enter into
the controversy as to who first gave evidence of the changing attitude.
So careful a critic as Theodore Watts assigns the place
of priority to Thomas Chatterton, styles him the Father of the
Romantic School, and insists that to his influence may be traced
some of the best work of Keats and of Coleridge. It will always
be well to remember that changes in literary habit do not take
place in a year, rarely in a decade. It will, therefore, be easy
to point out poets as early as Gray who gave prophecy of the
new era. This much at least is noteworthy&mdash;putting aside the
question as to who comes first of all&mdash;that the new current of
ideas began very early to flow through poets who were hardly
more than boys. Professor Beers has already reminded us that
in Joseph Warton as well as in Thomas Chatterton&mdash;neither of
whom was more than eighteen years of age&mdash;we may see the
set of the literary current.</p>

<p>It may not be insisting too strongly on a parallel to see in
the history of Southern literature a state of affairs much like
that we have just sketched. It will be remembered that in 1818
Bryant sounded his protest against a "sickly and affected imitation
of the peculiar manner of the late popular poets of England."
As late as 1848 Lowell did not hesitate roughly to assert:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They stole Englishmen's books and thought Englishmen's thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With English salt on the tail our wild Eagle was caught.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In these circumstances it is not surprising that Sydney
Smith should have asked with suggestion of truth even if with
evidence of venom, "Who reads an American book?" American
literature in the Northern and Middle sections escaped from
bondage many years before the South came into its own literary
inheritance. Just as unreasoning worship of a pseudo-classicism
had its death-grip on Eighteenth Century writers so a like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
uncritical devotion to the usually read classic writers and to
earlier English authors had checked the growth of the budding
Southern literature of the first half of the Nineteenth Century.
Conservative as the South has always been in matters of thought
it was not surprising that this should be so. Paul H. Hayne
tells what contemptuous references were made by the literary
coterie of Charleston to the early efforts of Simms because he
dared aspire to cultivate the Muses, when he must needs get
his Homer through the medium of Chapman or of Pope. This
respect unto classical authority was of long continuance among
cultured men and showed itself, also, in the dry and tedious essays
of Legare who was reputed a great scholar.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, not until 1870 that the South may be said to
have achieved literary independence. As the sway of Greece
and Rome passed away, the South came to be a literary dependency
of England. Kennedy and Sims are dominated by Scott,
just as Wirt and his friends of the "Old Bachelor" group got
their inspiration from the Spectator. Of course there were poets
as Hayne and Timrod and story-writers as Johnston and Thompson
who sang and wrote clearly and with a note of individuality.
But Lowell might have described the greater part of Southern
literary work in the words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your literature suits its each whisper and motion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what will be thought of it over the ocean.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With the same thought in mind Poe wrote that "one might
suppose that books, like their authors, improve by travel, their
having crossed the sea is with us so great a distinction."</p>

<p>This natural conservatism was upheld by the fact that many
Southerners of means sent their sons to England to be educated.
The South being settled for the most part by emigrants of English
blood, it is not surprising that the controlling influence
should be from mother-country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Before the war, Sydney Smith's cutting question might have
been answered with greater suggestion of truth in the form,
"who reads a Southern book?" A not untruthful answer
would have been, "Southerners do not." We have never adequately
supported our own writers. We have added to the
tragedy of nations by allowing Poe to die the death of an outcast;
Timrod to break his heart, without a crust to eat or a penny
to buy food; Lanier not to have time to record the strains that
were demanding utterance, in order to spend his wasting
strength seeking support for wife and children; Russell broken
in courage and in fortune to find not even a resting-place in the
soil of his native State. Before the war the Southern library
shelves were weighed down with Fielding, Smollett, Addison,
Johnson, Scott and Dickens. Charleston had a public meeting
to congratulate Macaulay on the issuance of one of the later volumes
of his History. Simms and Timrod lived in the City by
the Sea in obscurity and neglect. We have not yet reached the
place where we turn first to our own writers.</p>

<p>To say we had no writers, no books is not true. We had a
plentiful supply of books whose writers with a kind of literary
metonymy transferred the conventionalities and commonplaces
of English life to the atmosphere of the South. The result was
not English and it was not Southern but it had the worst features
of both. Wax flowers were long a popular form of domestic
art and the literary amateur caught the unreality of the maker
of flowers.</p>

<p>There was, indeed, abundant material in the South and
much of it was made use of. A distinct weakness in our workmanship
arose from the fact that too much material was used for
a given purpose. The stage was overcrowded with characters,
the plot was weakened by using too much incident. This surplus-age
of incident seems to have distracted the writer's attention
from the details of his craft. The value of the work of art
was lost in carelessness of workmanship. The new order of
things was to see a renaissance of simplicity. It was to be ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>pected
that in order to bring about a re-crystallization of Southern
literary canons a shock was essential. That shock came in
the form of the war between the States. New ideas, newly expressed
was the inheritance.</p>

<p>The new school of Southern writers found their material
near at hand and yet from a past growingly remote. They delighted
to tell of the days of slavery&mdash;to idealize that period,
perhaps&mdash;and with some acquaintance with slavery as it actually
existed. While it has not been a half century since the master
and his slave lived together in Southern lands, yet the number
of those who have had experiential knowledge of slave-life in the
South is increasingly small. To be accurate the picture of master
and man had need to be painted quickly.</p>

<p>Perhaps the very first of our writers to give a true picture
of negro life in negro dialect was Irwin Russell of Mississippi.
He was certainly the first to make use of verse to put before us
the negro as he saw him. Russell's negro is for the most part
not the slave but the negro who is reconstructed in his legal relations,
but altogether unreconstructed in habits of thought and
of action. That negro, a picture of whom was to be had only
during the decade immediately after the war, is the hero of
much of Russell's verse. That he has pictured the character
faithfully is evidenced by the fact of the life of his work. Despite
encouragements to die, the slender volume of posthumous
verse still lives and seems destined to have permanent place in
American literature.</p>

<p>Russell's place in our literary history does not depend solely
on the estimation put on his own work but is assured by the
fact of his influence on those he preceded in this new field. Joel
Chandler Harris was one of the first to recognize the genius of
Russell and he doubtless looks upon the power of the young poet
as one of the formative influences of his life. Likewise Thomas
Nelson Page delights to ascribe to the Bard of the Quarters the
inspiration of his own literary life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be remembered that in sketching the English Romantic
Movement the fact was recorded that the boys Warton
and Chatterton occupied a place of prescience with regard to
these new ideas. It will be worth while calling to mind that
Irwin Russell's relation to the Southern Romantic Movement
was much the same. Already at sixteen years of age, he had
begun to write and ten years later he had completed his work and
returned his talents to him who gave them.</p>

<p>The parallel to be drawn between the life of Chatterton
and of Russell is interesting if not suggestive of actual brotherhood
of thought.</p>

<p>As mere boys they both began to write verse. They both
made use of a medium other than mother tongue. Chatterton
manufactured for himself a speech we cannot do better than
describe as the Rowley dialect; Russell put into form the rude
speech of the negro with whom he had grown up; yet he had
no help in the difficult work of transcriber.</p>

<p>Chatterton found the tasks set for him in a lawyer's office
unbearable while there was poetry in his mind to be written
down; Russell was actually admitted to the bar but the Muse
of Letters had marked him for her own and the courtroom
knew him no more. Breaking away from the bondage of legal
drudgery, Chatterton went with high hopes from Bristol to
London where for a few short months "the unhappy boy" strove
against starvation only at last to be overcome in the struggle
for living.</p>

<p>Russell left Port Gibson and went to New York to enter
upon a literary life but after buffetings not a few, he at last
entered into the eternal rest not vouchsafed on earth to that
weary, outworn body.</p>

<p>Chatterton may be granted place as forerunner of that
noble body of poets who have had part in making the poetry of
the Nineteenth Century as distinct contribution to English
literature. Before Irwin Russell there were, indeed, fore-gleams
of the day that was to dawn, but it may not unfairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
be urged that he was the first to turn his camera on one section
of our Southern life and give us a picture that has cause to
be enumerated among the monuments which must be consulted
as primary authorities by the historian who will picture the life
and thought of the Southern people.</p>

<h2><a name="WILLIAM_WARD_A_MISSISSIPPI_POET_ENTITLED_TO" id="WILLIAM_WARD_A_MISSISSIPPI_POET_ENTITLED_TO">WILLIAM WARD, A MISSISSIPPI POET ENTITLED TO
DISTINCTION.</a><br />

BY DABNEY LIPSCOMB</h2>


<p>A gentleman of advanced age, ripe culture, and extensive
knowledge of the literature of the State, was asked, "Who is
the best poet Mississippi has produced?" Promptly he replied,
"William Ward of Macon." Respect for the opinion of the
one who so unhesitatingly adjudged this pre-eminence among
the poets of the State led to a study of William Ward's life and
poetry, the result of which is now presented.</p>

<p>At the outset, however, let it be understood that the purpose
of this essay is not to establish Mr. Ward's supremacy as
a poet. Classifications of this kind in literature and elsewhere
are generally unsatisfactory and often invidious, for excellencies
that vary greatly in kind are not to be measured in degree.
Some would doubtless accord pre-eminence to Irwin Russell for
his humorous, sympathetic pictures of the quaintly sage and irrepressibly
happy old-time plantation negro. Others would as
likely claim this honor for James D. Lynch of West Point, who,
against over two hundred poets of America, won for himself
and his State, by unanimous vote of the committee of awards,
the proud distinction of welcoming the nations of the world to
the great Columbian Exposition, and afterward of having his
salutation ode adopted as the Press Poem of America. Of him
and his works more will be said on another occasion. Other
classes in attempts at gradation would prefer this one or that
one for reasons as different as the peculiar merits of the poet or
the tastes of the admirers.</p>

<p>Panegyric cannot perpetuate a reputation. If so, Tupper,
whose fame was predicted, would live as long as the language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
would now be more than a name. Joanna Baillie, too, whom
even Sir Walter Scott describes as sweeping her harp</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Till Avon's swans&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awakening at the inspired strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deemed their own Shakespeare lived again,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&mdash;where is she? Mindful of the futility of claiming for an
author more than is warranted, no eulogy will be offered, extravaganza
will be avoided. On the contrary, that criticism will be
eschewed which "damns with faint praise" what is cordially
admired, fearful lest others may not assent. William Ward
and his poems shall speak largely for themselves; knowledge of
the man and his work being sufficient, it is believed, to justify
the claim that he is a poet entitled to distinction.</p>

<p>Like many others who have reflected honor on the State,
he was a son of Mississippi by adoption, a New Englander by
birth. Son of William and Charlotte Ward, he was born in
August, 1823, at Litchfield, Connecticut, an historic village, the
early home of the Beechers; once noted also for its famous law
school, attended by many from the South, John C. Calhoun
among the number. Scarcely less was it famous for the beauty
of the surrounding scenery and for the aristocracy of its leading
families, who boasted their descent from old English houses
as much as did the Virginians of their Cavalier and the Carolinians
of their Huguenot ancestry. Social aristocracy in New
England was a more prominent feature of life there than is
commonly supposed. Among the leading families of Litchfield
was that of the Wards. William, father of the subject of this
sketch, was a jeweler by occupation, a man of integrity and
unusual intelligence; wealthy until middle life, when it appears
that reverses overtook him. For this reason his children, excepting
one, perhaps, did not receive a college education as was
intended. John became an Episcopal clergyman; Elias a jeweler,
like his father; Henry, sorely disappointed in not being
able to attend Yale College, scholarly, poetic, took reluctantly to
printing an editorial work; Mary Charlotte, literary in her
tastes, married a wealthy gentleman, traveled in Europe, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
wrote sketches of travel and a number of poems. Of Henry
Ward, a word more in passing to indicate more fully the literary
leaning of the family. At the age of thirteen, his poem, "Novel
Reading; or The Feast of Fiction," published in the local
paper, gave him notoriety and raised great expectations.
Thwarted in his college aspirations looking toward the ministry,
he grew melancholy and excessively reserved. After forty
years of life as a practical printer and editor, he left at his
decease manuscripts in Greek, Latin and Hebrew, versification
of the Books of Job and Lamentations, and a volume of hymns.
His claim to the well-known hymn, "I Would Not Live Always,"
generally accredited to William Augustus Muhlenberg, and also
to the poem, "Tell Me Ye Winged Winds," usually ascribed
to Charles Mackay, is set forth in Harpel's Poets and Poetry
of Printerdom. In it, too, may be found other poems by him
and several by his sister Mary, then Mrs. Webster.</p>

<p>But to William Ward, the youngest son, attention must
now be turned exclusively, with a glance first at the brief but
important period of his life spent in his boyhood home. Of those
early days which evidently left deep impression on his after
life, less can be said than could be wished. The beauty of the
country about Litchfield must have impressed him as it did
Henry and Harriet Beecher, born amid the same surroundings,
ten or twelve years before him. Like them, no doubt, he gazed
with delight on the glorious sunsets which Mrs. Stowe so enthusiastically
describes, and roamed in perhaps the same mood
the woods in which they speculated whether Apollo had not
there once built his altars. He, too, wandered along the banks
of crystal Bantam River and dreamily watched the clouds as
they hooded and un-hooded Mount Tom in the hazy distance.
Nature there surely must have been "meet nurse for a poetic
child."</p>

<p>His scholastic education was completed under the tuition
of a learned Episcopal clergyman whose private academy for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
boys was well patronized. He was an insatiable reader and a
fairly good student, though his mind ran in literary lines rather
than to the study of the exact sciences. The classics he must
have especially preferred, and in them been carefully instructed,
judging from the familiarity he manifests in his poems with the
mythology and literature in general of Greece and Rome.
Astronomy seems to have laid strong hold upon him; for it held
high place in his esteem in later life. He early gave evidence
of a poetic tendency, and some of his boyish effusions are said
to have possessed considerable merit. Intuition, environment,
and reading apparently combined to make of this New England
lad a poet. What the experiences of active life contributed in
this direction, a look ahead will show.</p>

<p>When only sixteen years of age, a great and unexpected
change in his plans and prospects occurred. He was urged by
his brother Elias who had gone South and set up in business
at Columbus, Mississippi, to come and learn under him the watch
repairing and jewelry business. Though his tastes and aptitudes
led in opposite direction, the opening seemed too favorable to be
set aside. The invitation was accepted and bidding adieu forever
to the home of his love, with mingled enthusiasm and trepidation
the young man set out on his long journey to the South.
Embarking at New York on a sailing vessel, he reached Mobile,
Alabama, after a safe but lengthy voyage. Of the experiences
of that voyage which afterward gave coloring to some of his
most poetic lines and of the amusing incident attendant upon
his arrival at Mobile notice cannot now be taken.</p>

<p>Ten or twelve years of quiet busy life at Columbus, Mississippi
constitute the second distinct period in William Ward's
comparatively uneventful life. His letters home indicate that
many of the sights and incidents connected with life in that
almost frontier land were new and startling to the scholarly
youth from staid Connecticut. By degrees he became accustomed
to his surroundings, and identified himself with the so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ciety
and business of the place. Modest and reserved in public,
with his friends he was ever a genial and interesting companion.
More student than mechanic, he would doubtless have preferred
a literary career. As it was, his literary tendency continued
to assert itself, and before attaining his majority verses from
his pen began to appear in print. At twenty or earlier he became
a contributor to the Philadelphia Saturday Courier, to
which for ten years or more thereafter he continued to furnish
poems or themes chiefly classical and patriotic. First in order
of time of those that have been preserved is "The Grave of
Hale," which appeared in the issue of June 3, 1843. In smooth
and vigorous Spenserian stanzas, he protests against the neglect
of the martyr-patriot's grave.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Alas! and hath no gentle honoring hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But that of Nature decked his tomb with flowers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We mourn the heroes of some storied land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And leave a cold and barren grave to ours."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among other published poems of his early period indicative
of his devotion to the classic Muse, and of his ardent patriotism,
may be named "The Egean," "Greece," "The Bellman of '76,"
and "Our Own New England."</p>

<p>These lines from the first two poems, written respectively
in 1844 and 1845, but for the dates might seem to have been
inspired by the result of the late sad struggle between the
Greeks and Turks:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Bright sea! no more the naiad haunts<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy pearl founts with a syren spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sea-nymph on thy foam-bed pants,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Within her rainbow spawning cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The halo of departed years&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sleeps like a dream upon thy sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the dark curse of blood and tears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is echoed back with freedom's sigh."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh Greece! could ye but boast of Greeks the shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That gathers o'er thee now would make thy altars flame."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>For the tenderness and warmth of sentiment expressed
therein, the poem, "Our Own New England," merits more than
simple reference to it. The last stanza shows how thoroughly
Southern in ten years he had become. Friendships strong and
lasting had been formed, and he was now prominent among the
citizens of a town that even then prided itself on its culture.
One of the intimate friends of Alexander K. McClung, he has
left an appreciative tribute to that powerful, but somber and
erratic genius.</p>

<p>In 1850 Mr. Ward removed to Macon; Mississippi, and there
lived till his death in 1887. Early in the fifties he married
Miss Emilie A. Whiffen, an estimable and highly cultured young
lady of English parentage, then teaching in a female institute at
Crawford, Miss. The Philadelphia <i>Courier</i> contained a pleasant
notice of the marriage, from which this extract is taken: "We
sincerely congratulate our esteemed correspondent, William
Ward, Jr., Esq., whose delightful verses have enriched but too
seldom our Poet's Corner, upon the agreeable fact reported in
our hymeneal department last week." These were his halcyon
days, during which he was prosperous and serenely joyful in
his home. In 1856, he built in the woods skirting the eastern
edge of the town the modest but tasteful little cottage in which
he spent the remainder of his days. To verse he seems to have
given but little time during those busy years; though occasionally
he still contributed a poem to the <i>Courier</i> and to the Macon
and Columbus papers. Three daughters and a son came to increase
his pleasures and his cares. Meanwhile the war cloud
lowered and the tempest broke in fury on the land he had learned
to love and call his own. But this was little heeded in comparison
with the calamity which befell him in the midst of those
dreadful days in the loss of his devoted and helpful wife. His
life "cleft in twain," as he expressed it, from that time forward
is thus described by one who knew and loved him: "To his half-orphaned
children he became father and mother. We have seen
him in his cottage home spending his evenings in the bosom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
his little family, assisting his daughters with their lessons, amusing
the children, looking after their comfort, and doing all in
his power to make them happy. Proud and sensitive, he bravely
struggled through poverty that came to so many Southern
families; and though at times obliged to add the office of housekeeper
to that of bread-winner for his young family, he never
sank the dignity of a gentleman to the servility of a drudge."</p>

<p>Under these circumstances, all the more honor is due to
him that after the war he spurned the offers of place and wealth
extended by carpet-bag leaders of the Republican party who
knew of his Northern birth. Instead of such a course, he became
in 1870 editor of the Macon <i>Beacon</i>, and was as pronounced
a Democrat as he had been Whig in former years.
During intervals of work in his little shop he hurriedly wrote
his editorials; and might often be seen walking up and down
behind the counter evolving a poem or a prose reverie, oblivious
to his surroundings. But to poetry he gave no more time
than, as he said, he <i>must</i>. Outside the joys of companionship
with books and with his children, he could truly have exclaimed
with Burns:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lease me on rhyme! it's aye a treasure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My chief, amaist my only pleasure."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>With his little ones, on Sundays, he walked in the woods
hard by his house; and on clear nights he often pointed out to
them the stars and constellations, and told them of the myths
that cluster about Orion, the Pleiads and other denizens of the
nightly firmament. He had his own telescope and frequently
searched the heavens with it for hours. "It is well," he says,
"to look upon the Christmas skies when the most glorious constellations
of the year are gathered as at the world's great festival.
It will give us higher conceptions of life and tone down
excesses we too often indulge in through the anniversary week
that closes up the year."</p>

<p>But let us look more closely at the man himself and then
give his work such examination as time left us will admit. Tall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
slender, erect in carriage, clean shaven, with dark brown hair
and eyes, rapid in his movements, the scholar and the gentleman
written unmistakably on every lineament, and William
Ward, the man, is as nearly portrayed as can now be done; for
except a little daguerreotype taken for his wife, which has been
lost, he sat for no other picture. Singularly reserved and almost
shy in public, with his children and with his intimate
friends he was delightfully communicative, a vein of quiet
humor often outcropping in his words and deeds.</p>

<p>Public life he generally avoided; offices which he might
have held, he would not accept, although urged upon him. A
loyal, ardent Odd Fellow, like Abou Ben Adhem, he "loved his
fellow-man," and was loved by them in turn. His addresses
and poems on the anniversaries of this order, and at decorations
of the soldiers' graves were much admired. Though educated
for an Episcopal clergyman, he never united with the church,
at least in the South, more than as a vestryman for a time. It
is to be regretted that, with outward eye so quick to see and
interpret the true and beautiful, his eyes of faith could not discern
more clearly the full truth and beauty of God's written
Revelation. If so, his pathetic lines on "Hope," composed a
few years after his wife's death, would have had a more triumphant
ring than is contained in the last two stanzas. Elsewhere
hopes shines brighter and faith soars on stronger wings, as when
in his "In Memoriam" poem to his wife, he sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Still for this grief so desolate, so lone,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A solace for unmated hearts is given,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another hand, another voice hath known<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The symphonies of heaven."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the sixty-fourth year of his age, at the season he loved
best, the Christmas-tide, December 27, 1887, the gentle spirit
of William Ward softly slipped from its earthly moorings. His
body by loving hands was tenderly laid to rest in the cemetery
at Macon, his home for nearly two score years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>His spirit still lingers with us, embodied in the songs which
he sang, now out of a glad, now out of an aching heart. Well
has it been said that a poet least of all needs a monumental
pile. The Iliad towers high above the Pyramids, and will outlast
them by ages. William Ward has left no Iliad; he sang
not of the gods and demi-gods; he struck the lyre, and not the
full-resounding harp. Intuition, early environment and scholastic
training, as has been shown, combined to make of him a
poet. Life's dull and dark experiences seemed to repress but
could not suppress in him the "noble rage." Visions of beauty
continually flitted in his imagination; music from choirs, visible
and invisible, seemed ever to soothe and charm his troubled,
lonely heart. Especially in the closing years of his life was
poetry a joy and comfort to him. As the burdens of life were
shifted to the shoulders of his children, he found more leisure,
it appears, and indulged more frequently in poetic expression
of the mood or thought that deeply stirred within.</p>

<p>As might be supposed, his poems are of as diverse themes
and varied measures as the moods and occasions which suggested
them. In them may be best shown the poet and to some extent
the man; hence, they deserve and, it is believed, will repay a
full and close investigation. Hear him first, as in patriotic
strain, he invites the world to his adopted land:</p>

<p>No prosy pen could have indited those picturesque and
stirring lines.</p>

<p>In his Centennial Hymn, "The Victory of Peace," in "The
Blue and the Gray," "Under Two Flags," "Gettysburg" and
other poems, his muse dons American colors and echoes the national
note of peace and unity.</p>

<p>In "McMahon at Sedan" he strikes the martial measure
with trumpet note. Many more stirring war lyrics could not
easily be found.</p>

<p>But his muse was also often pensive, and in that mood he
softly sings as if to himself alone. Among the best of these
poems of reflection are "A Memory," "Alone," "Nebulae,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and "Look Up." In them the visions and the melody evoked
are often strangely beautiful and haunting; but a depressing
undertone like a sigh runs through them all.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The misty realm of dream-land lies before me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O Sleep! in thine embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shadows from the past are flitting o'er me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What mocking memories traced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dim procession, slowly wafted onward,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Prolongs the dreary moan<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That finds an echo in that fated one word,<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Alone! Alone!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From "The Master Thought" and "If Tongues Were
Steel," the conclusion might be drawn that a cynic set words
to the tunes. The last stanza of the first of these is keenly
pointed and sadly near the truth:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Still man, though born a Socrates or Nero,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If white with truth, or black with falsehood's taint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would rather gleam in marble as a hero,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than glow on canvas, pictured as a saint."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His intense hatred of shams and fraud of every kind occasionally
found indignant voice; as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O God! were all the lies distilled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From supple lips in cunning skilled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell would be stretched and overfilled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aye, moulded in one burning curse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twould wreck a shaken world; nay worse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would crush and damn a universe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But these were transient and rare utterances. "Though
far from the east the youth had traveled, he still was Nature's
priest." The boy dreamer among the Connecticut hills is now
a poet on the Southern prairies.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And by the vision splendid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is on his way attended."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The glory had not yet passed from earth." Nature beckoned
him continually, and gladly obedient to the summons, he
sought her haunts, caught the visions, heard her minstrelsies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and forgot the while his burdens, his loneliness, and his long
sorrow. Many of his poems in whole or part might be cited in
proof of this. Most prominent are "The Dying Year," "The
South Wind," and "The Night Storm."</p>

<p>For its rich setting and striking presentation of a common
theme this poem is reproduced entire:</p>


<h3>THE DYING YEAR.</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The year is dying as the dolphin dies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not with the ashen hue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death's signal color, ere the fading eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">See dimly, darkly through<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waxen lids. No pallor creeps along<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The earth and sky; no tone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floats through the air like a funeral song,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or like a dying groan.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The warm rich sunlight gilds the autumn trees<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whose gorgeous tints are spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each toning each, and fringed with heraldries<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of purple, gold, and red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crimson myrtle burns upon its stem<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As though a heart of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yellow maple, like an oriflamme,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lifts up its banner higher.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The oak is rich with russet, bronze and brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And there a purple crest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams o'er the forest like a lifted crown<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some color-god has blest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loosed by the frost, the sumac's pallid leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like yellow lance-heads fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While lights and shadows ever shifting weave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A net-work over all.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O queenly autumn! though you proudly lead<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The old year to its death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glory comes and goes where'er you tread<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With every dying breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The year is dying&mdash;dying as a king<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dies in his purple. Now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shroud is woven, and its colors fling<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A glory o'er his brow.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>
<p>The cold, the night, the storm, were especially congenial to
him. He almost literally "kept open house" throughout the
year; for he would hardly permit his doors to be closed even in
the coldest weather. On his gallery he delighted to stand or
walk and watch a thunder storm, especially by night, as his
graphic picture of "The Night Storm" fully testifies. But
nature in her gentler aspects was also at times very attractive
to him, as this stanza must suffice to show:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O warm South Wind! awake and send<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Across the sea that breath of thine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let its lotus fragrance blend<br /></span>
<span class="i4">With the rich odor of the pine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er land and sea your treasures bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From zones with health and beauty rife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To youth the fullness of its spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To age, the aftermath of life."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Particularly noticeable, and often fascinating through
their witchery or weirdness are a number of Mr. Ward's poems.
Of those through which fancy sports most winsomely are "The
Lake of the Golden Isle," "St. Nicotine, a Christmas Phantasy,"
"Just Twenty-Two," and "Katie Did."</p>

<p>The last was extensively copied in the press and much admired.
It will bear another repetition.</p>


<h3>KATIE DID.</h3>

</div></div>

<p>Somewhat more thoughtful but scarcely less charming is
the little lyric "Just Twenty-Two," which closes with the plea,
"Leave me immortal at sweet twenty-two."</p>

<p>With "The Neophyte" in 1851, the supernatural and
mysterious elements, traceable perhaps to Coleridge and to Poe,
began to appear in his poems, and became conspicuous in "The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
Burning Casque," "The Phantom Train," and "The Ride of
the Ku-Klux." At places in these, the breath comes short and
quick, and the nerves grow unsteady in the presence of grotesque
phantoms and direful mysteries. Few pass a real train
without a pause and look of mingled awe and admiration. A
momentary glance at "The Phantom Train" should certainly
be taken:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On the track stood the engine cold and still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For throttle and valve had ceased to thrill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the giant power of the wizard steam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the track, by the lantern's gleam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far on the night, till it seemed to meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a point at the dim horizon's feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there in the distance, faint and far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glimmered a blue and ghostly star.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nearer and nearer it came and grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till it gleamed in a circle of ghastly hue.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">

       *       *       *       *       *
<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">By the Holy Saints! 'twas a gruesome sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever came from the womb of night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spectral train that, nigher and nigher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was whirled on its silent wheels of fire.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"The Ride of the Ku-Klux" is even more gruesome and
fantastic, but the appearance of those terrible night regulators
cannot satisfactorily be shown by a brief extract.</p>

<p>Several poems of personal character deserve notice for both
their merit and the associations connected with them. The noble
lines to George Peabody may be found in Harpel's "Poets and
Poetry of Printerdom," to which reference has been made. In
it, too, are published "The Blue and the Gray," "The Frosted
Pane," and "The Ride of the Ku-Klux." It is unfortunate
that a poem which elicited the following interesting note cannot
be designated, perhaps is lost:</p>

<p class="right">New York, March 11, 1872.</p>

<p>Dear Sir:</p>

<p>I thank you for the privilege of reading your beautiful
poem, and regret that I could not have been its inspiration. I
wrote once a poem for the Atlantic entitled "The Heart of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
War," but never one with the title of yours. You will pardon
me, I am sure, for relieving you of the burden of a mistake
which was very complimentary to me.</p>

<p class="center">Yours very truly,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">J. G. Holland</span>.</p>

<p>Shakespeare and Dickens were particular favorites of Mr.
Ward's, one of his last purchases of books being a new set of
each of these authors. For Byron also, as a poet, he entertained
a high regard; but perhaps the literary character whom he
loved the most was Oliver Wendell Holmes to whom on his
seventy-fifth birthday he addressed an affectionate and admiring
tribute, which called forth this response from the genial Autocrat:</p>

<p class="right">Beverly Farm, Mass., Oct. 5, 1884.</p>

<p>My Dear Sir:<br />
</p>

<p>I beg you to accept my sincere thanks for your very pleasant
lines. I am sorry they were too late for the birthday number
of The Critic; for they would have been reckoned among the
best and most graceful of all that were sent. Believe me,</p>

<p class="center">Gratefully yours,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Oliver Wendell Holmes</span></p>

<p>The most popular poem, however, of this class is one dedicated
to Wyatt M. Redding, the telegraph operator who during
the yellow fever epidemic of 1878 bravely died at the post of
duty in the plague stricken city of Grenada. For its historical
as well as poetical value it should be preserved.</p>

<p>Passing several poems of genuine humor and two or three
more lengthy ones of epic cast and tragic interest, this appreciation
of William Ward's life and poetry, though incomplete
must find an end. What poetry in the abstract is, the world
has not yet determined, and probably never will. Whether it
be "the rhythmical creation of beauty" or the "lyrical expression
of emotion," or both; whether its end be truth or beauty
or merely sensuous delight, one or all, each will decide for himself,
according as he is provincial or cosmopolitan in his culture.
What is poetry to one is doggerel or riming prose to another.
"The Ring and the Book" is intolerable to many who enjoy
"The Idylls of the King." Wordsworth is for the most part
childish or meaningless to numbers who delight in Scott or
Byron. Where Poe is lauded, Whitman very likely will be
scouted.</p>

<p>Individual estimates of William Ward's poems will, therefore,
vary according to the tastes and training of the reader.
But it can hardly be doubted that they will appeal strongly to
a majority of the lovers of true poetry. If imagery be preferred,
it is conspicuous throughout his verse; if emotion be specially
sought for, it too in almost every type pulsates in these
poems; if music be the criterion, in that also they will not be
found wanting, for the melody and harmony of most of them is a
striking characteristic. That they might be judged on their
own merits, and not so much on the opinion of one who might
be deemed more advocate than critic, fuller selections by way
of illustration have been offered than would have been the case,
if the poems could readily be found. They were published
mostly in the Philadelphia American Courier, the Macon Beacon,
and the New Orleans Times-Democrat, and have not been collected
in book form, as it is earnestly hoped they yet will be.
Better known, it is confidently believed that they will place their
author high on the roll of Southern poets.</p>

<p>As a summary and a conclusion, the following Report of the
Committee on Necrology to the Press Convention of Mississippi
in 1888 is here appended:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>"One of the oldest members of this association, who had
not an enemy on earth, the urbane, genial and ever agreeable
William Ward is with us no more. Those of us who knew and
loved him for his big heart and true manly worth, will sadly
miss his gentle footfalls, cheerful face, and warm hand-clasp as
we meet in our annual conventions. The voice of him who sang
songs of love, devotion, and duty, is as silent as the marble
shaft that marks his resting place.</p>

<p>"Born in a New England village up among the hills of old
Connecticut in 1823, Mr. Ward came South when a youth of
tender years, to seek a home in the land of sunshine and flowers,
fit prototypes of his own sunny self. A poet by nature and a
writer of purest English, he gave to the press some of the sweetest
poetic gems that have graced the literature of the South;
and his poems addressed to or read before our press conventions
were always regarded as the chief features of an entertainment.
With them he was wont 'to set the table in a roar,' or draw
tears from the eyes of the most obdurate. He wrote his name
high on the scroll of fame, and through all the vicissitudes of
life, from the days of his early manhood when struggling to
support a growing family to the evening of his declining years
when surrounded by the comforts of life, that name remains as
pure as a star, as unsullied as the snowflakes falling in mid-heaven.
In all the relations of life, William Ward was ever a
true and honorable man, loving and beloved by all who came
within the circle of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>"Let the recollections of this New England youth who cast
his lot with the South, and who lies buried in its soil ever remain
fresh and green in our heart of hearts; and now let us
pluck a flower from the chaplet of memory, and tenderly lay it
upon his hallowed grave."</p>

<h2><a name="SHERWOOD_BONNER_HER_LIFE_AND_PLACE_IN_THE" id="SHERWOOD_BONNER_HER_LIFE_AND_PLACE_IN_THE">SHERWOOD BONNER&mdash;HER LIFE AND PLACE IN THE
LITERATURE OF THE SOUTH.</a><br />

BY ALEXANDER L. BONDURANT, A. M. (HARVARD)</h2>


<p>The life of Sherwood Bonner illustrates the union of the
subtle elements, ancestral traits and personal qualities, which,
distilled by the alchemist, Dame Nature, in her alembic produce
the individual.</p>

<p>Her father, Dr. Charles Bonner, was born in Ireland, but
his family left their ancestral home when he was quite young,
and settled in Pennsylvania. When he arrived at man's estate,
he left the North, and like Prentiss and Boyd turned his face
Southward. He reached Mississippi in "Flush Times," and
was content to dwell there, for he found a cultured, refined
people, who recognized in him a kindred spirit.</p>

<p>In her novel, "Like Unto Like," Sherwood Bonner thus
describes the home of his adoption: "The climate was delicious.
Winter never came with whirl or wind and wonder of piling
snow, but as a temperate king with spring peeping to meet him,
before autumn's rustling skirts had quite vanished round the
corner. Yet there was not the monotony of eternal summer.
Winter sometimes gave more than hints of power to the pert
knaves of flowers who dared to spring up with a wave of their
blooming caps in his face; and the peach-trees that blossomed
too soon were apt to get their pale pink heads enclosed in glittering
ice-caps, through which they shone with resplendent
beauty for a day then meekly died. Even a light snow fell at
times; and everybody admired it and shivered at it, and said
the climate was changing, and built great wood-fires, and
tacked list around the doors, and piled blankets on the beds, to
wake in the morning to find sunshine and warmth&mdash;and mud.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
But for the most part, the days, one after another, were as perfect
as Guido's dancing hours."</p>

<p>She thus speaks of the people whom both she and her
father loved: "They had the immense dignity of those who live
in inherited homes, with the simplicity of manner that comes
of an assured social position. They were handsome, healthy,
full of physical force as all people must be who ride horseback
---- and do not lie awake at night to wonder why they were
born. That they were Southerners was, of course, their first
cause of congratulation. After a Northern tour they were glad
to come home and tell how they were recognized as Southerners
everywhere&mdash;in the cars, shops, and theatres. They felt their
Southern air and accent a grace and a distinction, separating
them from a people who walked fast, talked through their noses,
and built railroads."</p>

<p>The young physician found the sun which caused the flowers
to bud, to blossom, to give forth rich fragrance not less kind
to the daughters of the Southern village whither he had journeyed;
but one seemed to him fairer than all the rest, and he
sought to make her his own. Miss Mary Wilson is said to have
been both lovable and beautiful. Fortune favored his wooing
so they were soon wedded. Their means were ample and Dr.
Bonner retired from the active practice of his profession, dividing
his time between the management of his estate, and the dispensing
of an elegant hospitality in his own home. He was
always a great lover of books and possessed a fine mind, but had
no ambition beyond his class; and while believing in and honoring
woman to the highest degree, he thought her place to be
the home.</p>

<p>His library was large and carefully selected, and he directed
in large measure the reading of his family. We surmise that
the daughter is giving an episode in her own life when she has
Blythe Herndon tell Roger Ellis that she never disobeyed her
father's injunction about books but once, that having exhausted
everything else in the library, she climbed up to the forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
shelf and took from it a copy of "Tom Jones." But, says
Blythe, "papa scolded; to this day I have never known whether
Tom married Sophia." Dr. Bonner was an honorable, courteous,
cultured gentleman, another Thomas Dabney. The daughter
being asked by Mr. Harper, of Harper and Brothers, where she
obtained such a fine command of English, replied with great
dignity, "In my father's house."</p>

<p>From her father Sherwood Bonner inherited her love for
books, and her keen sense of humor, her best gift from the gods;
from her mother came beauty and a charming femininity.</p>

<p>Five children were born to Dr. and Mrs. Bonner; Katharine
Sherwood, born February 26, 1849; Ruth Martin, now Mrs.
David McDowell, who lives at Holly Springs, Mississippi;
Samuel Wilson, who died of yellow fever in '78; and two other
children, who died in infancy.</p>

<p>The family residence built by Dr. Bonner is still standing.
It is a commodious brick mansion, built in Gothic style, with a
wide portico in front, and ample windows opening to the floor.
The house stands well back from the street, surrounded by a
spacious lawn. One enters a wide hall, and on the left is seen
the library, where in winter a wood fire is kept burning. The
room is a very charming one, and afforded a most appropriate
setting for the writer at her desk. This room is connected with
the hall by folding doors. On the right is the drawing-room.</p>

<p>One seeing the fair haired baby-girl in this luxurious, well-ordered
Southern home, would probably have said that she was
destined to become what her mother before her had been, charming,
well read, and, according to prevailing standards, educated.
But in addition to these inherited qualities, Sherwood Bonner
possessed that strong individuality that made her a writer. As
a child she was fond of play, but she loved books and stories
better still, and games ceased to charm, if gran'mammy consented
to tell her the story of the wonderful adventure of "Breer
Rabbit" and "The Tar Baby," or some of his other escapades,
or if her papa came in bringing her a fresh volume of fairy
stories.</p>

<p>Her first effort at original composition was while she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
still wearing pinafores. It came about in this way: she and a
playmate lost their temper, and, forgetting that they were little
gentlewomen, began to fight like two waifs with no family dignity
to uphold. Kate got her frock torn, and later when her
mother asked her the cause of the quarrel, she handed her a
paper, with a tragic air, saying, "read this, it will tell you all."</p>

<p>She was not universally popular as a child, for she manifested
a precociousness that separated her, in large measure,
from her kind; but she attracted strongly those whom she really
liked and was, at an early age, the queen of a little coterie of
her own. In childhood she was distinguished for loyalty, a
ready wit and a keen sense of humor; qualities that made the
warp and woof of her nature, and but strengthened when the
maid was merged in the woman.</p>

<p>Her education was conducted under her father's eye, and
as he pressed the chalice to eager lips, little did he guess that
he was entertaining genius unawares. At school she could not
have been accounted a hard student. Her mind slaked its thirst
at the pure fountain of the muses; history was a joy, literature a
delight, and the composition, a task hated by most of her schoolmates,
a pleasant pastime; but she looked askance at the sciences,
and pronounced life too short for geometry. During her last
year at school she wrote an allegory. It is the work of a tyro
in art, but was regarded by her schoolmates a remarkable production.</p>

<p>The morning of her life was bright, and with father, mother,
sister, brother, around the family hearth, each passing day
brought added happiness. Even the dark clouds that began to
lower in the North, ere she passed the limits of girlhood, did
not bring sadness, for she with many older heads in the South
failed to comprehend what these foreshadowed. But she was
now to receive the baptism of sorrow, and to gain through suffering
needed training and added strength.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who tears to other eyes would bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must first have tasted sorrow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She was just sixteen, she had written something and it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
been accepted, her heart was aglow with visions of the future,
when the desolating blow fell upon her home. The much loved
mother was taken from her, the rude shock and turmoil of war
being too much for that gentle spirit.</p>

<p>We find this entry in Sherwood Bonner's scrapbook in her
own hand: "First story ever published, aged fifteen, <i>Boston
Ploughman</i>, twenty dollars." Underneath, the story is pasted
in. It was called "Laura Capello, A Leaf from a Traveler's
Notebook." It is a mystery story, highly melodramatic and
crude, but containing the promise of a rich fulfillment as the bud
contains the rose. It deals with the lot of a young girl whose
life is the fruit of unhallowed love. The scene is laid in Italy,
the land of mystery, and the story is given to the world by a
young American artist, whom a capricious fate enmeshes, and
make an unwilling actor in the drama. The sketch shows dramatic
power, and abounds in vivid description.</p>

<p>Mr. Nahum Capen, the author of "The Republic of the
United States," "History of Democracy," and other works, was
at this time connected with <i>The Ploughman</i>. He was the friend
of Longfellow, Lowell and Emerson, and was selected by Hawthorne
as the first one to read his first book, which appeared
anonymously. He was the intimate friend and adviser also of
Irving. Under his tutelage Sherwood Bonner first essayed Grub
street, and he never ceased to take a keen interest in her, and was
to the day of her death her trusted adviser and friend. He
urged her to write, and encouraged her work with kindly, but
discriminating words of praise. "Laura Capello" was followed
by "A Flower of the South," published in a musical journal.
Somewhat later a piece called "An Exposition on one of the
Commandments" was sent to <i>Frank Leslie's Journal</i>.</p>

<p>In 1871, Sherwood Bonner became the wife of Mr. Edward
McDowell, a gentleman of refinement and liberal culture; like
his wife he was a native of Holly Springs. The young wife assumed
with earnestness the responsibilities of the new life and
when her husband determined to try his fortune in the frontier
state of Texas, she went with him into a country that was little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
better than a wilderness. But the venture failed and the young
people returned to Holly Springs poorer in purse than when
they left. A daughter was born to them, and for her child henceforth
the mother in large measure seemed to live. Like George
Sand, she found in motherhood love's deepest expression. At this
crisis of affairs, the young wife and mother recalled her talent,
and remembering the kind words that had come to her from
Boston, she determined to go thither, and try her fortune with
her pen. In Boston she became a member of Mr. Capen's family,
and under his eye, and with his encouragement, continued her
work.</p>

<p>She had the gift of clear vision, and at once perceived that
the defects of her early training must be overcome if she was to
write that which the world would read; so she studied closely,
books, men and manners. The North received her lucubrations
with a criticism that was in the main kindly, and ere long she
had made for herself a place in "The Moral Lighthouse" as she
playfully denominates Boston. After several years she was able
to have with her her child and the aunt who since her mother's
death had striven to supply her place. But she counted that she
was only sojourning in the North. The place of her birth she ever
spoke of as "home," and a portion of each year she spent amidst
the dear familiar scenes.</p>

<p>Soon after going North she met the poet Longfellow. He
recognized her talent, became her warm personal friend, and
lent her aid and encouragement in her work. She in turn seemed
to impart new vigor to the white-haired poet. She became his
private secretary and collaborator. At her suggestion he compiled
"Poems of Places, Southern States," and she assisted in
this work. It is a quaint conceit of the poet which causes him
to treat the South as a separate country. In that interesting book,
"Poets' Homes," appears a description of Longfellow's home
written by her. It is given the place of honor in the book, but
by a strange oversight no credit is given to the author. In one
of her early letters from Boston, published in the <i>Memphis Ava<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>lanche</i>
she writes: "A great man and a poet, who enjoys the
additional distinction of being my very good friend, read my
first letter written for your columns, with an evident amusement,
which he made a commendable effort to suppress. 'This is too
bad,' frowned he, between smiles, 'don't do it again. Write about
the good side of Boston next time.'"</p>

<p>She wrote a number of letters for Southern newspapers in
a style that the ordinary newspaper man would strive in vain
to emulate, though she regarded the letters as mere potboilers.
They give interesting accounts of the happenings in Boston,
and her impressions of Boston's great men: Emerson, William
Lloyd Garrison, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Wendell Philips.
She says of Boston: "For the native Bostonian there are three
paths to glory. If his name be Quincy or Adams, nothing more
is expected of him. His blue blood carries him through life with
glory and straight to heaven when he dies. Failing in the happy
accident of birth, the candidate for Beacon Hill honors must
write a book. This is easy. The man who can breathe Boston air
and not write a book is either a fool or a phenomenon. One course
remains to him should he miss fame in both these lines. He must
be a reformer."</p>

<p>She thus speaks of her meeting with Mr. Emerson: "The
unaffected charm of Mr. Emerson's manner soon restored me to
my normal serenity, and the interview progressed delightfully
for both of us. He has the purest and most refined face I have
ever seen, and his smile is something to be remembered forever.
Of course we spoke of the South, and he expressed the opinion
that the Southern man had a more elegant manner and a finer
physical frame than the Northerner, but must generally yield
the palm in intellect. And to this I assented sorrowfully enough,
recalling as I did, the small returns from the stock I took in a
certain Philo club, where I spent the ambrosial evenings of my
life and pinned my faith to several masculine coat sleeves of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>tellectual
giants pro tempore, who would have brought my tawny
hair down in sorrow to the grave&mdash;if I hadn't taken the pin out.</p>

<p>"Mr. Emerson has a way of looking off into the distance as
he speaks or listens which is very poetic and beautiful. I liked
it, but yet I was not happy, for I had a knot of purple violets
in my hair, and I distrusted this way of appreciating them. I
don't wear violets every day; nor for the Colonel who talks politics
to me; nor for the young preacher who propounds chemical
conundrums. And so they meant something in this case! perhaps
to subtly express the homage of a Southern heart, that I had no
skill to put into words. I dare say, however, the great man received
a general impression of sweetness and perhaps it is well
he did not trace it to outside influences.</p>

<p>"On the whole, Mr. Emerson personally strikes me as one
who might falsify that comprehensive saying that no man is a
hero to his valet, as I cannot imagine him under any circumstances
other than the consistent high-toned man, who beyond all
scholarship and learning</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Still may hear without abuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Grand old name of gentleman.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>She thus describes her impressions of Carl Schurz, the occasion
on which she saw him being a Sumner memorial meeting:
"He is German in accent but not in appearance. His full whiskers
are red, not blonde. And his features have none of the Teutonic
heaviness, but are rather characterized by the sagacious
sharpness of the American. The eulogy was very fine, and repeated
bursts of applause testified to the enthusiasm of the audience.
Most especially I must note the warm and hearty reception accorded
that part of the address in which Mr. Schurz spoke of
the noble and manly stand taken by Mr. Lamar, of Mississippi,
and paid a just tribute to his brilliant eloquence, which was
especially grateful to my Southern pride."</p>

<p>In the following paragraph she gives her Southern readers
a pen picture of her poet friend:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Longfellow was there from his beautiful historic home.
Bret Harte calls him his 'ideal poet,' and as one looks upon his
gracious, benignant face, framed in silvery hair, and reverently
notes the broad thoughtful brow, and the eyes from which love
toward all mankind seemed to beam, it is easy to comprehend
how the perfect harmony between the man and his works should
win from one, a poet himself, the highest praise he could possibly
bestow."</p>

<p>In her stories Longfellow suggested that she write of the
life around her, but she chose, and wisely, the life of the South
that she knew best, and the poet admitted in the end that her
instinct had led her aright. Before '76 she wrote some of the
"Gran-mammy Stories" and other short sketches that found a
ready sale. Longfellow said that she would be "the American
writer of the future."</p>

<p>Eleven years after "Laura Capello" was written its author
visited the scenes where the plot was laid. She enjoyed deeply
this foreign travel, and has left a partial record of it in her
letters published in Boston and Southern papers, and in her private
correspondence. She writes thus to a friend from Rome: "I
am living every hour, never have I known days of such enchantment;
Roman violets that make the air sweet, Roman fleas that
bite with a Swinburne ardor, Roman donkeys that bray in the
early morning, Roman shops that bewilder with their gems,
shopmen who will make you buy whether you will or no; even
in these delights I revel, so what can I say of the pictures, the
statues, the ruins of Rome? Do you remember how my Lilian
exhausted her raptures after the first layer of her box, and sat
afterwards in a mute adoring ecstasy? Think of Lilian's mother
in the same position."</p>

<p>Several days were spent by her party at a little coast town
in France. At times the hours lagged, so the little group, like the
young people in the <i>Decameron</i>, devised game and story to
amuse themselves. Sherwood Bonner showed herself the most
fruitful of device, and became the leader in the sport. She devised
a game that was played with avidity. The loser each time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
was supposed to pay the forfeit by taking his life with his own
hands. A wan young Scotsman who had been "Ordered South"
chanced to be one of the party and participated in the game.
For the rest it was a pleasing pastime, but for him it had a tragic
suggestion, for at that time Robert Louis Stevenson&mdash;it was no
less than he&mdash;had begun that hand to hand conflict with disease
that terminated fatally twenty years later. It is thought that he
received from this game the suggestion of that very unusual
story of his, "The Suicide Club."</p>

<p>Home at last came this busy working bee after her flitting
in distant lands. "The Crest of the White Hat," "Rosine's
Story," and other sketches show the effect of this foreign travel.
The years following were filled with hard work; ever attaining,
but never quite satisfied, she strove to make each piece better
than the last. During this period she wrote a clever characterization
in verse of "The Radical Club," which set all Boston to
laughing.</p>

<p>Sometimes she had her hours of despondency as when she
wrote a friend, "Put up a tablet for me in case I join the mermaids
and write on it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Death came to set me free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I met him cheerily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As my true friend."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>During the summer of '78 yellow fever raged in many parts
of the South. The citizens of Holly Springs with a noble disregard
for consequences offered an asylum to the refugees from the
stricken town of Grenada; in this way the plague was introduced,
and of the first hundred who took the fever only ten survived.</p>

<p>Sherwood Bonner was in the North at the time, but she at
once hurried to Holly Springs to urge her loved ones to seek a
place of safety. But the old physician would not go and his son
remained with him; they were soon stricken with fever; she
nursed by their bedside during the weary hours of their sickness
and they died in her arms on the same day. She escaped the disease,
but left Holly Springs broken in health from her constant
vigils, and wounded in spirit. She wrote an account of the plague<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
for <i>The Youth's Companion</i>, from which the following extract is
taken: "It is not alone to see loved ones die; it is to dread their
dying kiss. It is not to watch the dear dead face until the coffin
lid is closed above it, but to turn, shuddering, from the face
where you can see waves of change follow each other, until it
has become a yellow transfigured mask. It is not to see the folded
hand clasping flowers, the dear forms enshrouded in fresh grave-clothes,
nor to see them laid away with prayers uttered above
them and friends standing by with uncovered heads, but it is to
know&mdash;with what intensity of horror!&mdash;that these forms are
changed to a poison so deadly, that death can be tasted in the air
around them, and love itself shrinks from rendering its last sad
offices. It is to know that they are buried, wrapped hastily
in sheets, sometimes uncoffined, hurried to deep graves, without
friends, or mourners, or care, by hirelings, who slight and dread
their task."</p>

<p>After the publication of "Like unto Like" she found ready
publishers. Mr. Conant, the editor of <i>Harper's Weekly</i>, said to
her, "I accept your articles now without reading them in advance,
your signature is enough." Enduring fame was hers if
she could only live to grasp it, but ere the noon hour was reached,
the worker was laid low. She began to feel the approach of an
insidious disease, which she strove in vain to throw off. Not wishing
to distress her loved ones she spoke of it to only a few friends,
who finally persuaded her to consult the best medical authority.
The physician when he saw her perfect physique expressed his
surprise at her coming. He made the examination, but hesitated
to state the result. She would have the whole truth and he pronounced
her death sentence, telling her that she had but a single
year of life. She met her fate with fortitude, and determined to
make the most of the few remaining months, in order to provide
a competency for the loved ones that she must soon leave.</p>

<p>She worked on to the very gates of death, her courage never
forsaking her; and even when her good right hand was useless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
she continued to dictate to an amanuensis, and was satisfied with
nothing short of the best work.</p>

<p>February 14, 1883, she wrote:</p>


<h3>A LONGED-FOR VALENTINE</h3>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come to my aching heart, my weary soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And give my thoughts once more their vanquished will;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of bounding hope, to reach its fartherest goal.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>A dear friend writes of the closing days of her life: "During
her hours of suffering, her bravery, her patience, and her
heroism were extraordinary. One who watched by her dying bed
said: 'I have seen her smile when it would have been a relief to
see her cry.' She uttered no complaint and no one heard her repine.
One day she gaily asked her friends what would be a suitable
inscription for her tomb-stone; and from several that had
been suggested she selected this, 'She was much loved.' Surely
no words could furnish a more fitting epitaph for the young life
that had done so much, enjoyed so much, suffered so much, in a
little more than thirty years." The end came July 22, 1883.</p>

<p>Sherwood Bonner cast the witchery of her personal charm
over all who surrounded her. Nature formed her to command, to
love and to be loved. In childhood she was slight, but in womanhood
she possessed a perfect physique. Hers was no usual beauty;
her features were refined, but not regular: her complexion a
delicate pink and white; expressive blue eyes, her hair an indescribable
shade of auburn and very heavy; an exquisite mouth
and chin; and a hand that would have been a sculptor's joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>The poet Longfellow in a poem dedicated to her thus describes
her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A cloud-like form that floateth on with the soft undulating gait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one who moveth, as if motion were a pleasure."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Her heart was always true to the friends of her youth, and
when they visited the North she was ever ready to introduce
them to the circle of which she was so prominent a member.
Adulation did not spoil her for she had the artist's perception
with her woman's heart. Hers was a trenchant tongue and a
stinging wit, but like the Venusian bard she was quite as ready
to hold up her own foibles to ridicule as those of others.</p>

<p>She lived for her child, and nothing from her pen is more
charming than the references to her in letters to friends, hitherto
unpublished. In one of them she writes: "Now for my baby, she
certainly is the most perfect child in the world. No human being
knows how I love the little thing. Every plan of my life bears
upon her future, and so long as she is left me, nothing can ever
make me unhappy again."</p>

<p>We may not judge of her literary work as of a finished product.
It is rather like a sculptor's dream that is but half realized.
Lips are parted as if for speech, eyes look wistfully towards the
East; but the figure is still restrained in its marble prison, and
we wonder why the sculptor was stricken, the task unfinished.</p>

<p>But this unfinished work was fraught with rich promise.
She probably wrote the first story of any writer that belongs to
the distinctively Southern school. She wrote before '77 some of
"The Gran'mammy Stories," and these seem to be the first
negro dialect stories published in a Northern journal, and thus
speaking to the whole country. She wrote in '78 "Like unto
Like," a story that has to do with the reconstruction period.
Into this field Cable came later, and Page selected it as a fitting
period in which to locate his most ambitious work, "Red Rock."
Only one writer before her had attempted to work this virgin
soil, Baker in "Colonel Dunwoddie, Millionaire." In this book
she refers to the "Tar Baby Story," which she published several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
years later in <i>Harper's Monthly</i>. She wrote some excellent dialect
stories of the Tennessee mountains, thus doing pioneer work
in a field which Miss Murfree has made so peculiarly her own.
She spent some time beginning in 1880, in that portion of
Illinois known as Egypt; and "On the Nine-Mile," and "Sister
Weeden's Prayer" illuminate this dark world. These stories
and a number of others were written in the dialect peculiar to
this region. Of "Sister Weeden's Prayer" in the "new" dialect
<i>The Nation</i> spoke in most complimentary terms. She seems to
have been the first to give to the vernacular of this region literary
treatment, thus doing for Illinois what Eggleston and Riley
have done for Indiana.</p>

<p>Her principal writings may be grouped as follows: Early
pieces, '64-'73;&mdash;Letters from Boston and Europe, '74-'76;&mdash;Short
Stories published in periodicals between '73 and '83; a
number of these were collected after the death of the author
and reprinted in a volume entitled "Suwanee River Tales"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
(There are many excellent sketches in this little book, but the
best are those in which Gran'mammy figures); to this period of
her life belong "Miss Willard's Two Rings,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and "From '60 to
'65"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>;&mdash;"Like unto Like,"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> a novel, "The Valcours,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a novelette,
"The Revolution in the Life of Mr. Balingall,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "Two
Storms,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "A Volcanic Interlude,"<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> appeared between '78 and
'83. She wrote during these years besides, a number of dialect
stories dealing with negro character, the mountaineers of East
Tennessee, and the denizens of the Western prairie. "Hieronym<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>us
Pop and the Baby," "The Case of Eliza Blelock" and
"Lame Jerry" are all strong sketches. Some of these stories have
appeared in book form.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>The "Gran'mammy Stories"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> reveal with force and beauty
the characteristics of the old Southern "mammy," who deserves
a modest place with "The chaste and sage Dame Eurycleia"
and fair Juliet's nurse; and Sherwood Bonner has made posterity
her debtor by preserving the lineaments of this picturesque
personage whose place formerly was of so much consequence
in the Southern home. But let the author unfold her character:</p>

<p>"In our Southern home we were very fond of our old colored
mammy, who had petted and scolded and nursed and coddled, &mdash;&mdash; yes,
and spanked us,&mdash;from the time we were born."</p>

<p>She was not a 'black mammy,' for her complexion was the
color of clear coffee; and we did not call her 'mammy' but 'gran'mammy'
because she had nursed our mother when a delicate
baby,&mdash;loving her foster child, I believe, more than her own, and
loving us for our dear mother's sake.</p>

<p>She was all tenderness when we were wee toddlers, not more
than able to clutch at the great gold hoops in her ears, or cling
to her ample skirts like little burrs; but she showed a sharper
side as we grew old enough to 'bother round the kitchen' with
inquisitive eyes and fingers and tongues. I regret to say that
she sometimes called us 'limbs' and would wonder with many a
groan and shake of her head, how we contrived to hold so much
of the Evil One in our small frames.</p>

<p>"'I never seed sich chillern in all my born days,' she cried
one day, when Ruth interrupted her in the midst of custard making,
to beg leave to get into the kettle of boiling soap that she
might be clean once for all, and never need another bath; while
Sam, on the other side, entreated that she would make three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
'points' of gravy with the fried chicken for dinner. (Sam always
came out strong on pronunciation; his very errors leaned to
virtue's side.)</p>

<p>"'I 'clar to gracious,' said poor gran'mammy, 'you'll drive
all de sense clean outen my head. How Miss Mary 'xpec's me
ter git a dinner fitten fur white folks ter eat, wid you little onruly
sinners <i>furever</i> under foot, is mo' dan I kin say. An' here's
Leah an' Rachel, my own gran-chillern, a no mo' use ter me dan
two tar babies.'</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>"As gran'mammy grew older, her manner softened; her
love was less fluctuating. It was she to whom we ran to tell of
triumphs and sorrows; she whose sympathy, ash-cakes and turnover
pies never failed us. It was she who hung over our sickbeds;
who told us stories more beautiful than we read in any
books; who sang to us old-fashioned hymns of praise and faith;
and who talked to us with childlike simplicity of the God whom
she loved.</p>

<p>"During the troubled four years that swept like the hot
breath of the simoon over our country, she was true to the family.
Her love, courage, her faithful work, helped us to bear up under
our heavy trials. And when the gentle mother whose life had
been set to such sweet music that her spirit broke in the discords
of dreadful war, sank out of life, it was in gran'mammy's arms
that she died; and neither husband nor children mourned more
tenderly for the beautiful life cut short."</p>

<p>"How Gran'mammy Broke the News" shows the tact of
the faithful old nurse in revealing to "Aunt Sarah" the fact
that her soldier son, who was reported to have been killed in
battle, is alive and well, in fact has but a few moments before
arrived at that house. One of gran'mammy's foster children is
a witness of the scene. The little girl was for going to tell her
aunt as soon as her cousin arrived, but gran'mammy said: "Stop,
honey, stop; Miss Katie, you forgit. Don't you know dat joy
itse'f is sometimes more dan a breakin' heart kin bear? Mis'
Sarah is mighty frail; an' she mus' be made ready to meet dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
shock, for dis is jes as much a <i>shock</i> as de lie dat struck her down.
Blessed be de Lord for sendin' de last so quick on de heels of
de fust. * * * *</p>

<p>"Aunt Sarah's door was ajar. She was seated by the fire
in an attitude of utter dejection. Gran'mammy was bustling
about the room, an expression of perplexity on her dear old
brown face. Presently with a side-long glance at poor Aunt
Sarah, gran'mammy began to sing softly. I had never heard her
croon anything but Methodist hymns. Now, to my surprise, she
broke forth in a chant that Miss Rose was very fond of singing
with us after vesper service Sunday afternoons, 'Praise de Lord,
O my soul! O my soul; and forget not all his benefits.'</p>

<p>"At first Aunt Sarah took no notice; but, at a louder, more
vigorous, 'Praise de Lord, <i>Praise de Lord!</i>' she shook her head,
as if a gnat was buzzing about her ears, and looked at the singer
with a dull look of surprise in her weary eyes.</p>

<p>"'Gran'mammy <i>singing</i>!' she said, in a faint voice.</p>

<p>"Gran'mammy came and stood directly in front of my aunt.
She tried to laugh, but the tears tumbled out of her eyes so fast
that she choked in the effort to swallow them.</p>

<p>"'Why, yes, Mis' Sarah,' she at last manged to say; 'when
my heart is light with thinkin' of de goodness of de Lord I can
no mo' help singin' dan if I was a saint in heaven worshippin'
at de throne.'</p>

<p>"'The goodness of God!' echoed Aunt Sarah, drearily;
'He has forgotten mercy; He has turned His face from me; He
has left me desolate and forsaken in my old age.'</p>

<p>"'De Lord <i>never</i> forgits,' said gran'mammy, solemnly;
'an' He never fails to keep de promises He has made. Lean on
me, Mis' Sarah. Rest yo' po' tired head. Speak de name of yo'
boy, honey. It'll do yer good ter talk about him.</p>

<p>"'No, no, no!' said Aunt Sarah, shrinking back; 'I thought
you loved him, gran'mammy, but you could come to my room
and sing. Go away, I do not want you.'</p>

<p>"'I'll go, Mis' Sarah, in one little minute. Love Mars'
Allan! Why, wusn't my arms de fust ter hol' him&mdash;a little soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
helpless innocent&mdash;even before you held him to yo' own mother's
heart? An' from that very minnnit I loved him. I kin see him
now, a little white-headed boy, always runnin' ter his ole granmammy
fur turnovers an' ginger-cakes. Hevn't I watched him
all through de years, growin' as straight an' tall as a young
poplar, full of his jokes, but with never a mean streak in him,
bless de Lord! An' den, Mis' Sarah, don't you mind how he
looked in his grey uniform, wid de gold lace on his sleeves; an'
how his eyes would kindle an' his voice ring out when he talked
of de country he loved next ter God?'</p>

<p>"'Gran'mammy! do you want to break my heart? Why do
you torture me?' And Aunt Sarah burst into such wild, wild
tears that I was frightened.</p>

<p>"'Oh! my po' sweet mistis, I wants to <i>mend</i> yo' heart, not
break it;' and gran'mammy, too, burst into tears, kneeling now
by Aunt Sarah, with her arms around her. 'I wants you to call
ter mind jes' one thing&mdash;de commandment given by de Lord to
his people, <i>given wid a promise</i>. Kin you say it over ter me?"</p>

<p>"'Honor thy father and thy mother,' said Aunt Sarah,
like one in a dream, 'and thy days shall be long in the land&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Stop dar, Mis' Sarah,&mdash;<i>stop at dat promise</i>,' almost
shouted gran'mammy. 'Did Mars. Allan honor his father an'
his mother?'</p>

<p>"'Always! Always! He never disobeyed us in his life. No
son could have been better or nobler.'</p>

<p>"<i>And thy days shall be long in the land</i>," cried gran'mammy,
'which the Lord thy God giveth thee!' Now, Miss Sarah,
jes <i>trust God</i>. He won't break dat promise.'</p>

<p>"Words cannot do justice to the solemnity, the yearning
tenderness, the pathetic earnestness, that made the dear old
woman like one inspired. Wave after wave of feeling rolled over
her face. I do not know how to express it, but a sacred, even a
<i>religious</i> rapture seemed to hold her in its possession. Strong
feeling had exalted her, I felt as if I should like to steal in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
pray beside her. She still knelt, but she kept her arms about the
frail figure in the arm-chair.</p>

<p>"Wild, vague suspicions were evidently forming in Aunt
Sarah's mind. She looked at gran'mammy&mdash;a piteous, agonizing
gaze. But gran'mammy's eyes met hers with steady joy.</p>

<p>"'What do you mean?' she gasped huskily. 'In God's name,
what do you mean?'</p>

<p>"'I mean,&mdash;lean on me, dear, lean on me,&mdash;I mean dat if
our blessed Lord wus on earth today, an' we could kneel at his
feet askin' de life of our boy, he could not give it ter us. For
Allan's grave has not been dug, an' Allan is livin' not dead
today.'</p>

<p>"'What have you heard?'</p>

<p>"'A messenger has come.'</p>

<p>"Then I saw a transformation. Aunt Sarah sprang up, the
color and light flashing into cheeks and eyes, the vigor and erectness
of youth restored to her shrunken and bowed figure. No
longer a haggard old woman,&mdash;like a girl she threw open the
door, and swept past me without a word."</p>

<p>"Gran'mammy's Last Gifts" has to do with the closing
hours of her life.</p>

<p>The children that the old nurse had tended from infancy
now gather around her bed. She had her daughter look in her
chest and take from it a parcel. "The parcel was handed her,
and taking off the outer covering, a white one was revealed; then
a third wrapper of silver paper. Slowly, reverently, she unwound
this; and there were two tiny, high-heeled satin slippers, yellow
with age, but dainty enough for fairy feet.</p>

<p>"'De night your mother was married, honey,' said gran'mammy
proudly, "nobody waited on her but me. I unlaced de
fine weddin' dress,&mdash;all lace an' satin,&mdash;an' I put de white nightgown
over her head. An' when I took de slippers off her slim
pretty feet, she flung her white arms aroun' my neck, an' she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
says, "keep 'em gran'mammy, in memory o' dis night." An'
now, my chile, arter all dese years, I gives em ter you' de fustborn,
your dead mother's weddin' slippers.'</p>

<p>"I could not speak for my tears. Was there ever a gift so
delicately bestowed? I pressed the slippers to my heart kissing
them and the faithful black hands that had taken them from the
little feet so many years ago.</p>

<p>"'Now my little singin'-bird,' said gran'mammy to Ruth,
'I was boun' you should remember me; so I jes' went to de
picture man, an' here's my ole black face for you to keep.'</p>

<p>"The likeness was perfect; and as Ruth warmly thanked
her she sank back wearily on the pillows.</p>

<p>"'I'm tired now,' she said, "Miss Ruthy, I'd like to hear
you sing once more&mdash;before I hear de angels on de other side.'</p>

<p>"Ruth hushed her sobs and in her exquisite voice rolled out
in those beautiful words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Only waiting till the shadows<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have a little longer grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only waiting till the glimmer<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of the day's last beam is flown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only waiting till the angels<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Open wide the mystic gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At whose feet I long have lingered,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Weary, poor and desolate."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"'Only waitin', murmured the dying voice. 'O my chillern!"
and she spoke with sudden energy. 'In your hearts you are
pityin' your poor ole gran'mammy; you are thinking o' de sun
shinin' outside, an' de fllowers, an' home an' love. You see me
lyin' here, ole, an' black, an' racked wid pain. But oh! what's
de sunlight of earth to de glory roun' de throne of God? what's
de flowers here ter de flowers in de gyardin younder? An' what's
de love of earth ter dat waitin' for me, sinful an' onworthy
though I am?</p>

<p>And with her beloved nurslings around her gran'mammy
passed quietly away. Amongst her last words were, "Good-by
Miss' Marthy, take good keer o' Miss' Mary's chillren."</p>

<p>"Two Storms," one of her latest stories, published in <i>Harper's
Monthly</i>, deserves especial notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>The story has to do with the gulf coast. We see a fair young
wife with a husband who idolizes her, and a little daughter with
her faithful black mammy. The mother dies suddenly, and the
husband is felled by the blow. In his despair he curses Fate and
would die. His child he neglects, in fact her presence is disturbing,
since it but serves to remind him of his irreparable loss.</p>

<p>Little Dinah's lot is a hapless one. It would be tragic were
it not for the devoted old nurse, who watches over her "Shorn
Lamb" with a tenderness not to be surpassed by a mother.
"'I wish I were a little dog' she said once to Maum Dulcie,
'then I could lick papa's hand, and perhaps he would pat my
head.'</p>

<p>"'You po' little sweet rosebud!" cried the old woman,
'Ain't you got yo' ole nuss to love you an' pet you?'</p>

<p>"And in her compassionate tenderness Maum Dulcie did
her best to spoil her charge by too great indulgence. * * *</p>

<p>"When at last she aroused from the long trance of her
illness, it was to find a face she had dimly feared all her life,
bent above her with a rapturous protecting love, to hear a
father's voice murmuring: 'My child, my little Dinah, forgive
your father for all you have suffered. It is over now, and we will
begin a new life hand in hand.' Safe in the purest love man ever
gives to woman, she rested on her father's heart; and Maum
Dulcie said weeping: 'I dunno but it's a sin to give thanks fur
dat Las' Islan' storm, an' I is as sorry as anybody fur de mo'ners
an' de dead, but I can't help seein' de good dat de Lord
brings out o' calamity."</p>

<p>She dedicates "Like unto Like" to Longfellow in the following
verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O poet, master in melodius art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O man, whom many love and all revere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take thou with kindly hand, the gift which here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tender from a loving reverent heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For much received from thee I little give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet gladly proffer less, from lesser store;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing that I shall please thee still the more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thus consenting in thy debt to live.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>
<p>The story has to do with that time when the South Niobe-like
still mourned her dead, and was unable to grasp fully the living
present. The opening chapter reveals three Dixie lassies standing
on the bridge at sunset&mdash;Blythe Herndon, Betty Page and Mary
Barton. Each is a real flesh and blood maiden; and while each
is southern, they differ much. Below them gurgles a limpid
stream and peering into the clear water they see clinging to stones
at the bottom moss, which twists itself into fantastic shapes.
Above towers a lofty mountain, the setting sun now giving it a
glowing aureole; from its base gushes a noble spring, the pride
of Yariba, for so this Arcadian village is named. Each maiden
speaks of the suggestion that this whirling, twirling moss carries
to her mind, and by these and other confidences exchanged on the
bridge we are enabled to form some opinion of the dispositions of
the young girls, who are important characters in the story.</p>

<p>As the girls talk on the bridge, Mr. and Mrs. Herndon approach.
They are still lovers after forty years; and sweet are the
memories that crowd upon them now, for it was here they
plighted their troth. They find the girls in animated conversation
about the advent of a Yankee regiment that is to be stationed
at Yariba for the summer. And these loyal young "rebels"
are not at all agreed that the officers should be received. Mrs.
Tolliver has consented to take Colonel and Mrs. Dexter to board,&mdash;brave
soul, it cost her many a pang, but she did it to aid her
husband's fallen fortunes. This decision causes a flutter, but
finally Mrs. Oglethorpe calls and where this lady leads all others
follow. With the regiment comes Roger Ellis, a man of middle
age, and an ultra-radical. He wins the heart of Blythe Herndon,
and then loses it again largely through his own fault.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>It is best to mate with your kind, this lesson the book teaches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>The story is briefly told, but its chief charm consists not
in the plot, which is rather slight, but in the local color and
character portrayal. The artist sketches from life. Squire Barton
(the chief of the village detectives), who always knows all
the happenings of the village, and thinks he <i>knows</i> much that
never happens; he is the selfsame squire whose refrain is, "Search
the whole world over, there is no place like Yariba," or "We are
a good breed in Yariba;" Colonel Dexter, whose eyebrows are
askew, the one fierce the other mild; Civil-Rights Bill, the little
darky whose antics amuse the reader, but often bring him summary
punishment from his old black gran'mammy; Ellis the
enthusiast whose passion is reform; Blythe's grandmother, who
has ceased to pray to her God because he allowed the Southern
cause to fail; Mrs. Roy, the mountain woman, called 'po' white
trash' by the plantation negro, but having a pathetic life, and
individuality all her own; the forerunner of many others that
appear later in the sketches of Craddock, McClelland and Sherwood
Bonner; Aunt Sally, the old laundress, (she would have
much preferred to be called a washer'oman), who sniffs at a
wash board and beats her clothes, "I'se no puny Alabama nigger,
I'se fum South Caliny, I 'longst to de oldest branch uv de
Tollivers;" Van Tolliver, the brave soldier, the true gentleman
who fought through the war, but accepted in good faith the
arbitrament of the sword, and in the New South made for himself
a place; Blythe Herndon, the idealist, who loved not wisely,
and waking found her dream shattered; Betty Page, the cool,
calculating coquette; Mary Barton, the loving, sympathizing
woman&mdash;all these are living breathing persons, not abstractions
or figures on a stage.</p>

<p>This book was well received by the critics. Mr. Longfellow,
in a letter to Mr. Harper of the firm, Harper and Brothers, says:
"It has marked and decided merit, is beautifully written, and
full of interest to North and South."</p>

<p>Mr. S. G. W. Benjamin wrote a highly favorable review of
the book for <i>The Literary World</i>, Boston, from which the following
extract is taken: "When a country is ripe for it, its lit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>erature
comes unsought and the authors who are its creators
appear. Among the various indications that such a literature is
at hand, not the least is the publication of such a remarkable
work as <i>Like unto Like</i>. In style it suggests the work of no other
writer; its merits and its faults are entirely its own; its characters
could only be found in our complex civilization. The plot
is founded on certain phases of American society, and is evidently
directly suggested by the author's personal experience and
observation. * * * The characters of Blythe, Ellis, the
abolitionist, Civil-Rights Bill, Mrs. Roy and the inimitable Mrs.
Oglethorpe, abundantly vindicate their right to a prominent and
permanent place in our literature."</p>

<p>A reviewer in the Providence <i>Journal</i> says: "We welcome
it as an olive branch in the truest and best sense of the word.
* * * There is not an attempt at fine writing in the book,
and yet it is full of painting from life. There is excellent comedy
and at least one scene of the deepest tragedy. Here and there
we are reminded of Miss Austen, the common scenes of life are
drawn with so much fidelity, but our American Miss Austen excels
her English sister in imaginative delineation of character,
and becomes the true poetess in the presence of nature."</p>

<p>Paul H. Hayne thus speaks of the work: "Regarded purely
as a literary performance, this work, as I have before intimated,
is exceedingly clever; in certain particulars even brilliantly
able. The descriptions of scenery, which in most novels bore one
unspeakably, are here vivid, picturesque and truthful, with
occasional displays of bright, poetic enthusiasm: and of the
<i>dramatis personae</i>, some are portrayed with quiet but significant
humor, some with keen, ironic shrewdness, and one at least (the
'Grandmother of Blythe Herndon') with a degree of tragic force
decidedly impressive."</p>

<p>The concluding extract is taken from a review of "Like
unto Like" that appeared in <i>The Boston Courier</i>: "Sherwood
Bonner's new novel in Harper's Library of American Fiction
is a book so original, so charming, so complete in itself, that to
write a review of it must be one of the most disheartening tasks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
possible. Not for many years has there been produced a novel
so broadly American, so un-provincial while yet retaining the
peculiar atmosphere of locality, and at the same time utterly unassuming
as to its representation of 'phase.' Its art is so good
and so fresh that it hardly impresses us as art; it is more nearly
nature. And yet the story abounds in traces of dainty skill, and
delightful appreciation of the shades and angles of character,
and perfect and easy adaptation of words to the transmission of
meaning, without that over-solicitude as to style which has become
so fatiguing in our recent New England school of fiction
writers. * * * The main thing to observe is that Sherwood
Bonner has seized the transition period of the feeling between
South and North so perfectly that her book will probably stand
in the future as the best representative of this episode in the
national life; and she has done this within the compass of a
simple tale which commends itself to our affections quite independently
of that special illustrative interest."</p>

<p>In <i>Harper's Monthly</i>, <i>Lippincott's Magazine</i> and <i>The Atlantic
Monthly</i>, the book was favorably reviewed. Sherwood
Bonner spoke of it as "a part of her training."</p>

<p>Mrs. Albert Anderson, her lifelong friend, wrote of her:
"To literature she was 'Sherwood Bonner,' the young author,
full of genius and promise; to society she was the beautiful, fascinating
woman, always the central attraction in every room she
entered, but to the companions of her youth she was only 'Kate,'
the loyal, brave, trusted friend, whose untimely death has taken
so much from life that it can never look the same again."</p>

<p>"Hers was a talent," says Dr. William Kirk "sure to expand
and develop; she observed life and learned from it and was
in no uneasy haste to record her impressions; the future was
hers through her individuality, if fate could have permitted it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
But for the work that she has done, which when weighed in the
balances still sustains the test, Sherwood Bonner should possess
for the students of Southern literature and Southern life, a permanent
and abiding interest.</p>

BY CHARLES CLIFTON FERRELL, PH. D. (LEIPZIG).</h2>


<p>It was on the 27th of June 1864 that Winnie Davis was born
in the 'White House' of the Confederacy at Richmond. The boom
of cannons in the distance seemed to celebrate this important
event,&mdash;the birth of a daughter in the reigning family. But in
reality the firing was not a manifestation of joy; many of the cannons
were hostile cannons which were ultimately to deprive her
of her birthright. The superior forces of the Union were closing
in upon the Confederate capital, and it was not long before it
fell, and the little girl, as well as her parents and friends, became
an outcast. She took part in the flight from Richmond, traveling
by day and night in an army ambulance for hundreds of miles
over rough roads through lonely woods, and being even carried
at times long distances in her mother's arms. It was a veritable
<i>via dolorosa</i>! The happy cooing of the baby alone comforted the
bleeding hearts of the family and brought smiles to eyes bathed
in tears. During the dark days of her father's imprisonment little
Winnie, who alone of the children was allowed to visit him,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
was the only sunshine that came to him. She liked to stay in his
cell, where she played and prattled, all unconscious of the sad
surroundings. She would put her arms round his neck, and he
would clasp her to his bosom, forgetting everything for the moment
except the baby fingers that were pressed against his cheek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>and the blue eyes that looked into his. It would be hard to overestimate
the comfort she afforded him while he was treading
the winepress of bitterness and humiliation.</p>

<p>Thus the infant had received the baptism of fire and deserved
the name of 'Daughter of the Confederacy.'</p>

<p>Mrs. Davis tells some interesting anecdotes of the little
girl's precocity, which I repeat in her own words. "When Winnie
was very small,&mdash;I think three years old,&mdash;her father was
reading aloud to me an essay on the refusal of a tomb to Byron
in Westminster Abbey. The nurse took her up to carry her to
bed and she called out: 'Oh, do leave me until I hear the rest.
The English will regret refusing their great man a grave in their
church;' showing she had comprehended the whole paper. Another
time, when she was five years old, she was asked: 'For what
was Abraham blessed?' 'For the manifestation of faith in hospitality,'
she answered. No one had told her in this phrase, for
I was her only teacher. At this same time she chanced to be at a
church meeting, waiting for me and heard us talking of the
minister's needs. For six months afterward she saved up her
little pennies and one day tipped up behind him and put them
into his hand, which was behind his back, saying: 'Dear Doctor,
buy everything you want,&mdash;here is the money.' She asked questions
which it taxed our mind and ingenuity to answer, and reasoned
out her own theories and adjusted facts so as to suit her
own ideas of right and justice. She could never become reconciled
to the fatted calf being killed for the prodigal son, and
sympathized passionately with the dutiful son who came from
the field overtired with labor in his father's service to hear
sounds of revelry in honor of the prodigal son, while he had
never been given a fatted calf with which to entertain his
friends."</p>

<p>The father took great pride in the development of his younger
daughter's bright mind. He and Mrs. Davis were her first
teachers and introduced her to the immortal writers that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
knew best. Before she could read she knew 'The Wreck of the
Hesperus,' 'The Fight at Coilantogle Ford,' and Allan-Bane's
song in the dungeon of Stirling castle, and had the Bible at her
tongue's end. At the age of twelve she knew by heart also many
striking passages from Shakespeare and was an ardent admirer of
the 'Wizard of the North.' In 1877 she was placed in a boarding
school at Karlsruhe, Germany, where she remained five years.
The mental and moral discipline maintained by the Protestant
sisterhood that directed the school was of the strictest kind; the
life was as secluded and as free from gaiety and frivolity as that
of a convent. In 1882 Miss Davis went to Paris, where she
studied French several months, and afterwards traveled extensively.</p>

<p>When she returned home she spoke German and French
more fluently than English, and was well-versed in European,
especially German literature and history, but had little reverence
for the learning and literary history of her own country.
Her parents began by dictations and by interesting excerpts
from Anglo-Saxon history to make her breathe their atmosphere
and adapt herself to their habits of thought. After her many
years of seclusion a new world opened before her young eyes
when she made her first appearance in the gay society of New
Orleans at the time of the Exposition. Now was formed her first
acquaintance with theatre and opera. She was well prepared
for this,&mdash;really her first encounter with life,&mdash;bringing to it a
mind vigorous by nature and well disciplined by the study of
history and economics. Hence, in spite of the great enthusiasm
with which she met the world, she was prevented from forming
any but just judgments of men and things. She was queen of
Comus this same season,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and somewhat later while attending her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
father on his triumphal procession through Alabama and Georgia
she was introduced to the Confederate veterans by General
Gordon as 'The Daughter of the Confederacy,'&mdash;an eminently
appropriate title which she always wore in a manner worthy of
her father's daughter.</p>

<p>In 1879 the family had moved to Beauvoir, where they lived
until the death of Jefferson Davis. Miss Winnie's devotion to her
father is said to have been beautiful. She was his constant companion,
accompanying him on all his trips through the South;
she served him as private secretary and assistant in all his literary
work. She would walk hand in hand with him by the
sounding sea; she would pore over volumes uninteresting to her
because she knew his heart was in them; she would read aloud
to him by the hour, and when he was weary she would sing to
him sweet old Southern songs. In fact she was the stay of his
declining years, succeeding in her effort to fill not only her own
place but that of the sons he had lost.</p>

<p>After the death of the husband and father, Mrs. Davis and
her daughter moved to the North. They felt that they must do
so in order to secure work, which was now a necessity.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It was
also a great advantage to them in their literary labors to be in
close touch with their publishers, and the Northern climate was
better suited to the mother's health. 'The Daughter of the Confederacy'
received an urgent and hearty invitation to attend
every function connected with the 'lost cause,' which she always
accepted when it was possible. Both hemispheres were
shocked at the announcement that her life had been cut short
at Narragansett Pier on the 18th of September 1898. As was
fitting, her body was buried at Richmond, where her cradle had
stood,&mdash;in that city which is richest in memories of the 'lost
cause' and all that is associated with it.</p>

<p>Splendid was the character of this woman who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
fondled and kissed in her babyhood by such men as Alexander
H. Stephens, Judah P. Benjamin, Stephen R. Mallory, and the
immortal Robert E. Lee. The hopes they expressed for her
future usefulness as they stood around her cradle were fulfilled
in rich measure. She always remained a child in her simplicity
and in her exquisite purity of soul; she was a woman in dignity
and in her ideas of justice before leaving the nurse's arms.
Even when she was a mere baby she resented any reflection upon
her truthfulness or sincerity; once when somebody reproved
her for a supposed fault and threatened to tell her mother, she
replied, "Do tell her, she always understands me; I am not
afraid of my mother." After she had become known as one
of the most cultured women of her time,&mdash;up to the very hour
of her death, in fact,&mdash;she did not give up her tender, baby
ways with her mother, to whom she would say simply, "I try
to be a good girl, do you think, dear, I am?" She was unaffected,
charitable, honest, and loyal. Her love for little children
was very marked; to the sick and afflicted she was a ministering
angel; she was almost worshiped by the poor people
and the children about Beauvoir. It is said that she never allowed
tramps to be turned away hungry even though she saw
them impose upon her repeatedly. She was a model listener
and would sit with her blue eyes shining with sympathy. Too
modest to lead the conversation, she did so only when her interest
in the subject and her knowledge of it made her forget
herself and inspired her to speak. She was chary of expressing
her opinions, which were honest and well-considered, and
especially disliked pronunciamentos.</p>

<p>Charles Dudley Warner, who knew her and loved her for
many years, pays a high tribute in an article as yet unpublished
to her sterling character and ingenuous face, her sweet disposition,
and power of great affection. He emphasizes her sympathetic
nature, her simplicity of manner, her open-eyed candor,
her transparent sincerity, and her unworldliness,&mdash;her disposition
to place spiritual things above material things. He was especially
struck with the fact that she was free from prejudice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
bitterness with regard to the war between the States. He had
reason to know that she rather shrank from the demonstrations
of the Confederate veterans towards her, as she was a little
timid in such matters, and had a very humble opinion of herself
and her merits and womanly reluctance to such publicity.
Yet she met the trying situation admirably, her tact and delicacy
preventing her from making any mistakes. She seemed
to the veterans the embodiment of those principles for which
they had fought, and she always remained true to the traditions
of her family and of her beloved Southland.</p>

<p>The first thing Miss Davis published was a little poem in
blank verse which appeared in 'The Times-Democrat;' it was an
address to a group of giant pines at Beauvoir and was signed
'The Colonel.' She was a member of a little literary club in
New Orleans called the 'Pangnostics,' at which each girl read
a paper at an appointed time. 'The Daughter's of the Confederacy'
chose for her subject Robert Emmet, in whom she felt a
strong interest because Mrs. Davis' grandfather, Colonel James
Kempe, of Natchez, had been one of Emmet's men before he
was sixteen. Besides questioning her mother closely as to the
stories which her great-grandfather had told about the ill-fated
struggle for freedom in the home of his youth, she read at least
twenty books on Irish history or subjects related to it, in order
to prepare herself for writing, 'An Irish Knight of the Nineteenth
Century,'<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> as the piece was called, contains a vivid portrayal
of the oppression of Ireland from the earliest times and a
sympathetic sketch of the young patriot, whose life was a romantic
tragedy. The author shows as great enthusiasm for
freedom as does Schiller in his 'Robbers.' Charles Dudley
Warner, who was present when the paper was read to the club,
was much pleased with it, and Mr. and Mrs. Davis were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
proud of it that they decided to have it published, expecting
only to distribute copies gratuitously among their friends. However,
it went through three editions, and although she had only
a small percentage on the books, which sold for twenty-five
cents, it brought the young girl $300. Mr. Ridpath once told
Mrs. Davis that it had gone through many Irish societies and
awakened much enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The next publication, entitled 'Serpent Myths,' appeared
in 'The North American Review.'<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It shows wide reading and
offers an interesting and ingenious theory to explain the origin
of these myths. After this came some short descriptions of
German life written for various papers and some clever bits of
versification which were never published. Two or three years
after her father's death she wrote for 'The Ladies' Home
Journal' a very strong article against foreign education for
American girls, on the ground that such education gives the
pupil a different point of view from her own people and puts
her out of harmony with her surroundings. This piece attracted
wide attention in the North as well as in the South. She
wrote for 'Belford's Magazine'<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> a clever criticism of Colonel
William Preston Johnston's theory that Hamlet was intended as
a characterization of James I, of England.</p>

<p>Miss Davis next resolved to write a book, and chose for her
subject a story her mother had told her about a veiled doctor
that had once attended a member of Mrs. Davis' family in Pennsylvania.
It shows the delicacy of her nature that she feared
she might wound the feelings of his family and accordingly laid
the scene of her story at Wickford, Rhode Island, in an old
house which she had seen there. The main incidents of this
novel<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> are true. As it is her most ambitious work, I will speak
of it in detail.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Doctor Gordon Wickford, the heir of the leading family in
a provincial town, has married a city belle. She is a beautiful
blonde, whose "glory lies in her hair," which she treasures
above all other earthly possessions, including her husband.
"He had prostrated himself spiritually before her beauty, and
demanded nothing but the acceptance of his adulation." Too
late he finds out that blind infatuation has caused him to marry
a woman who is so vain, shallow, and frivolous as to be utterly
unworthy of him. The uncongenial surroundings among which
she finds herself serve to accent her lack of loveliness of character,
and to widen the chasm between them. This becomes impassable,
as far as he is concerned, when he catches her in a
downright lie. Then he turns upon her for the first time, and
tells her that, while she may remain in his house, she shall
henceforth be his wife only in name. The spirit and determination
he shows reveal to her a force of character she had never
suspected in one who had been accustomed to yield to her in
everything, and she begins to respect him thoroughly. Only
after she has lost his love does she realize the value of it, and
then she strives to win it back, while a genuine love for him
begins to grow up within her own bosom.</p>

<p>As time goes on Wickford recognizes the fact that he is
doomed to die of cancer, that dread disease to which other members
of his family had already fallen victim. On returning
from the city, where his worst fears with regard to his condition
have been confirmed, he is thinking of seeking a reconciliation
with Isabel, his wife, in order that she may comfort him in the
trying hours that are to come. He hesitates because he has
heard her make so many unfeeling remarks about the afflicted
and infirm, and knows she cannot bear to come into contact
with suffering. While he is still in doubt what to do, a scene
of which he is an unseen witness convinces him of his wife's
infidelity, and in a moment of delirium he cuts off her beautiful
hair and throws it into the fire. After this he is ill of brain-fever
for a long time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>As he has completely ignored his wife ever since he discovered
that she had been lying, he is not aware of the change in
her feeling toward him. He persistently refuses to listen when
his old aunt attempts to plead the cause of Isabel.</p>

<p>His sensitive nature cannot bear the thought of everybody
seeing the mark of the loathsome disease as it slowly eats its
way, so he covers his face with a black veil, which he never removes.
He loses sight of his own condition in ministering to
the sufferings of others. Finally, after many months his own
hour comes, and he locks himself within his office, determined
that no mortal eye shall see his last sufferings. He writes a
letter to his wife beseeching her to respect his wishes in this
matter, and assuring her that by doing so she can atone for all
her sins against him. She obeys him to the letter, refusing, in
spite of vigorous protests, to allow anyone to enter his chamber.
She takes her position just outside his door, and listens with
agony to his moaning until the end comes, when she finds a note,
written just before he expired, in which he recognizes her love
for him and asks her forgiveness. After her own great sorrow
she is able really to sympathize with the sufferings of others,
and finally goes down to the grave respected by all who know
her.</p>

<p>Such is the story, briefly told. The title reminds us of
Hawthorne's parable, 'The Minister's Black Veil.' Both Doctor
Wickford and Parson Hooper put on the veil never to lay it
aside even for a moment, and the effect on the outside world is
naturally very much the same in both cases, but here the resemblance
ceases, for the cause is physical in one instance and
moral in the other. The selfishness and levity of Madame Wickford
find a parallel in the heroine of Benson's 'Dodo', while
her 'new birth' is not altogether unlike that of Marcella, who is,
however, an infinitely stronger character. More interesting
still is a comparison between our novel and 'The Forge Master'
of George Ohnet. Claire persists in receiving the advances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
her husband, Philippe Derblay, with such coldness that he finally
loses patience and pays her in her own coin. Her respect for
him is awakened, and when he is on the point of fighting a duel
for her sake, she rushes in between him and his adversary, revealing
to him the fact that she now loves him devotedly.
Thus a reconciliation is effected. I do not mean to say that our
author has borrowed anything from these stories, for, while she
is probably acquainted with them all, it is by no means certain
that she has read any one of them. I have mentioned these
points of resemblance merely because I think they are interesting.</p>

<p>I have heard the situations in 'The Veiled Doctor' characterized
as unnatural and melodramatic, and the style criticised
as stilted. With this opinion I cannot agree. Our author partially
disarms criticism by calling our attention to the perspective,&mdash;the
events being supposed to have taken place in "those
times when the lives of men and women swung between the two
poles of war's brutality and a super-refined sentimentalism,
which seems mawkish to their more prosaic grandchildren."
The ideals of different periods are not the same, and it is hardly
safe to take those of our own as a perfectly reliable standard
in judging those of another. For instance, to our age Goethe's
'Sorrows of Werther' seems full of maudlin sentimentality, yet
it was received with wild enthusiasm when it appeared, for it
mirrored perfectly the spirit of the time. All are agreed that
a story should harmonize, at least in a general way, with its
historical setting, for else we should be reminded of Horace's
picture of the figure with a woman's head, a horse's neck, feathered
body, and a fish's tail.</p>

<p>When we take into consideration the sensitive nature of
Gordon Wickford and the ignorance of the physicians of his
day with regard to the proper treatment of cancer, his desire to
die alone does not seem so unnatural, and, if this view be accepted,
Isabel's obedience is easily understood. It must be confessed
that the most sympathetic and practical character in the
book is 'Aunt Hannah.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>The style is not always what it should be, our author being
at times unable to resist the temptation to use high-sounding
phrases, but it sometimes manifests considerable strength, and
we find numerous bits of description that are really clever and
show excellent taste in their simplicity. I quote several passages:</p>

<p>"As yet the trees in the street had not completely hidden
their graceful branch-lines in new spring greenery; there were
still light young shoots in the box hedges, and the air was full
of the breath of the spring. In the old garden long lines of
crocus, yellow jonquils, and single blue hyacinths hedged the
grass-plots. The snowballs were covered with great foamy white
balls, periwinkles looked up clear-eyed from under the parlor
windows, and everywhere the single blue violets were making
the air sweet with their spring thanksgiving. The tall standard
roses had thrown out pale-green racemes, and the 'bridal-wreath'
bushes were just commencing to powder their branches
with miniature blossoms. A young moon hung like a reap-hook
in the evening sky; the bride and groom could see it between a
fret-work of flowery apple and pear branches as they paced
backward and forward in the soft air."</p>

<p>"At last the day broke rosy and splendid over a steel-blue
sea."</p>

<p>"There was a freshness on her cheeks and a dewy look
about her eyes that seemed to answer to the glory of the new
day, and to proclaim her an integral part of the summer
morning."</p>

<p>"Autumn had dressed the old town in sober suits of brown,
laced with yellow and red; there was a sharp tang in the salt
sea air that sent the blood dancing. The smell of the ripe apples,
crushed by the cider-presses, pervaded the orchards, and
in the fields the stacked dried corn showed the unsuspected
wealth of golden pumpkins that grew between rows. Out in
the woods the ferns had grown wan and pale, and the fading
leaves began to carpet the dead summer's undergrowth. Day
after day the officer and the lady rode away from the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>tree-shaded
streets to the silent autumn forests where silver-gray
oak-boles upheld canopies of brown velvet leaves. The gumtrees
burned like fire, and the hickory and sassafras gleamed
golden over the red sumach and whortleberry that made the old
fields seem deluged with the blood of some mighty battle. At
times the long lines of homing ducks would pass them, or a V
of wild geese would sweep over their heads, crying 'honk-honk!'"</p>

<p>"Evening had come on, and the bare boughs were etched
black against a lemon-colored sky, which melted into orange
where it kissed the horizon."</p>

<p>"The rosy glow in the west faded to ashen gray as the day
burned itself out."</p>

<p>"Autumn followed, spreading its rich India carpet of
leaves before the retreating footsteps of the dying year."</p>

<p>"Again the dawn swept up out of the sea, rosy and clear;
she could see the pink light of a new day on the western walls
of the passage."</p>

<p>"He labored under the oppressive aloofness begotten by sorrow,
which endows even the most familiar objects with a
strangeness borrowed from the new relation that we thenceforth
bear to our dead selves. The old landmarks seemed to be obliterated
by the torrents of his anguish and he felt no more of
the balm he anticipated from a sense of homecoming than he
might have experienced in entering any wayside tavern. His
disease created a spiritual alienation from all things, and in
his heart, like the Jewish lepers, he cried out perpetually, 'Unclean!
unclean!' proclaiming his eternal separation from humanity."</p>

<p>"There were all sorts of half-fledged thoughts nestling in
his heart as he strode out into the night."</p>

<p>"A sudden apprehension shook her, every overwrought
nerve in her body seemed strained to listen; the wind had risen
since dark, and was moaning in the chimney. She heard him
fumble with the bolts; it seemed an age before the door flew
open with a crash, and the storm rushed in whooping, making
the candles flicker and starting the smouldering logs into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
blaze. Some one was talking to the Captain in the hall; now
the door closed, and she heard his quick step coming back alone.
The presentiment of impending evil that had oppressed her all
day now took the form of anxiety for her husband; her fear
grew into an awful certainty of misfortune as she listened for
the Captain's return. Could Gordon have been taken ill?
Was there an accident on the journey? Could he even be dead?
'Oh God,' she prayed dumbly, 'not without saying good-bye,&mdash;not
angry with me, and without good-bye!'"</p>

<p>Finally, the moral of the book is one that has the sanction
of the father of Greek tragedy; it is the familiar adage that wisdom
comes through suffering. The strongest feature of the
story is its interest; I could hardly put it down before I had
finished it. This interest, which is inspired by its intrinsic
merit, is increased by the fact that it is the work of 'The Daughter
of the Confederacy.' While it is not a great book, it is well
worth reading.</p>

<p>Next came many unsigned essays for different journals,&mdash;a
Christmas story for 'The World,' and a pretty one called
'Maiblume' for 'Arthur's Home Journal.' Then followed a
comprehensive article on 'The Women of the South before the
War,'&mdash;before she was born. Mrs. Davis gave her the material,
and her beautiful, pure soul shed upon it the moonlight of
idealism. The piece last mentioned, as well as a remarkable
paper on her father's character as she saw it, was published by
McClure's syndicate.</p>

<p>Miss Davis was unusually well-versed in Chinese history,
as she had spent two years reading it because of her intention
of writing a Chinese novel. On this account 'A Romance of
Summer Seas' has so strong a <i>vraisemblance</i> that people thought
the author had visited the scenes so vividly described. Her
knowledge of the Chinese world is shown also in an article not
yet published which has for its title, 'An Experiment in Chinese
Money;' it was written at the time of the silver and gold contest.</p>

<p>It was a cherished wish of the dutiful daughter to put herself
in a position to buy a little home in a beautiful country district
and a little pony carriage for her mother and herself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
With this in view she wrote 'A Romance of Summer Seas,'<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
which she had first intended to call 'An Unconventional Experiment.'
She had contemplated writing a novel of which the
scene should be laid at Hong-Kong,&mdash;a novel of a more ambitious
nature than 'A Romance of Summer Seas.'</p>

<p>The 'unconventional experiment' consists in a young girl's
being forced by circumstances to travel under the sole guardianship
of a young Englishman from their home, Penang, off the
coast of the Malay Peninsula, to Hong-Kong and Yokohama.
The summer seas of the Orient and the two cities last named
form the background of the story. The pair are very reserved
and stand aloof from the other passengers until these begin to
gossip about them and to whisper that the relations between
them are not just what they should be. This causes two or
three fights, two challenges, and one duel, all of which might
have been avoided if the people on board had minded their own
business. It also brings about a marriage between the young
man and young girl in question, who have been awakened by
these rude happenings to the consciousness that they love one
another.</p>

<p>The characters are well-drawn and lifelike. Bush, the
Globe Trotter, who tells the story, proves to be a very entertaining
<i>raconteur</i> in spite of the reputation he has of being an insufferable
bore. He is loyal and true, and does not hesitate to
risk his life for his new-found friend. Malcolm Ralstone and
Minerva Primrose, the pair in whom the interest of the story
centers, are not idealized but thoroughly human. Guthrie, the
Kansas cattle king, is the best-drawn character of all; he is
kind-hearted and manly, but the personification of vulgarity,&mdash;one
of that type of Americans who travel much because they
think it is the thing to do, make themselves very conspicuous
by their loudness, bad manners, and ignorance, and do all they
can to bring our country into disrepute. They are aided in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
this noble work by such vulgarians as the American consul at
Hong-Kong,&mdash;these creatures who owe their prominence to the
abuses of our consular system. Miss Edwina Starkey is a revised
but unimproved edition of Mrs. Jellyby,&mdash;what Mrs.
Jellyby might have been if she had become a sour old maid.
Though an apostle of 'The Brotherhood for the Diffusion of
Light,' Miss Edwina has about as much of the true spirit of
Christianity as she has of personal beauty. Among the minor
characters Doctor Clark is admirably drawn.</p>

<p>The book contains many charming bits of description; one
has the feeling that Miss Davis must have visited these scenes
which she so vividly paints. The life on shipboard seems very
real. We find evidence of the closest observation of the world,
and the results of this observation sententiously expressed. A
quiet humor pervades the story, which is realistic in the best
sense and quite healthy.</p>

<p>I insert a few extracts.</p>

<p>"We were all up on deck enjoying the black glory of the
night,&mdash;stars set in a velvet pall overhead, and, below, the
phosphorus fringes that edged every ripple in the water and
made the ship's wake shine like a reflection of the Milky Way."</p>

<p>"As I sat there heedless of time, the light in the west faded,
and the great blue dome blushed with a thousand delicate gradations
of color, from the deep sapphire overhead, where the first
stars twinkled, through fainter blues and apple greens, until
everything melted into the gold of the horizon."</p>

<p>"So he went off, leaving me alone in the white glory of the
tropic night. No words of mine can convey the magic of that
moonlight, enveloping everything, and culminating in a glittering
path across the water. Every now and then a fish jumped,
and I could see its wet sides glitter; or a ghostly gull swept by
on silent wings, for when the full moon rides in the southern
sky, not even the birds can sleep, but wake and sing their songs
fitfully throughout the night."</p>

<p>"They sat at the window waiting, and watching the heat-lightning
play in the west and the reflection of the ships' lamps
that lay in the water like long yellow smudges. As the night
closed in the threatened storm swept up out of the sea, deluging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the city and whipping the quiet harbor into a foam; the thunder
crashed incessantly, and the flashes of lightning showed stooping
figures running along the bund to shelter, and hooded jinrikishas
tearing by, the coolies' grass cloaks dripping at every
blade."</p>

<p>"When one woman wishes to wound another she always
strikes at her heart."</p>

<p>"Black was very inky and white immaculate to this son of
the prairies."</p>

<p>"People never relish life as they do when the taste of death
is still bitter between their teeth."</p>

<p>"Her heart was as pure as crystal."</p>

<p>"Women are the most conservative things alive."</p>

<p>"The face he turned upon me was no more the face of
Minerva's lover than the sea in December is like the sea in
June."</p>

<p>"I venture to say that very few of the dead would be
entirely welcome if they returned unexpectedly to their widowed
affinities."</p>

<p>"Nothing is so perfect a guarantee of respectability in a
chance acquaintance as the names of your own friends on his
visiting-list."</p>

<p>"Many babies and Burmese summers had exhausted all the
elasticity she had ever possessed."</p>

<p>On the whole, 'A Romance of Summer Seas,' while it is on
a less ambitious scale than 'The Veiled Doctor,' seems more
natural and shows a gratifying advance along several lines.</p>

<p>When Miss Davis was suffering intensely in her last illness,
she would pat her mother's hand and say, "We shall have our
carriage when my book sells." But her unselfish dreams were
not to be realized. The career which seemed so full of promise
was cut short by death. Now we see through a glass darkly;
when we see face to face, we shall know why this life of usefulness
ended in its morning. As long as the memories of the
'lost cause' linger in her beloved Southland, so long shall the
name of Winnie Davis, 'The Daughter of the Confederacy,' remain
unforgotten. She has passed away, but the perfume of
her noble life will not pass away.</p>

OF MISSISSIPPI.</a><a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a><br />

BY FRANKLIN L. RILEY, PH. D. (JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY)</h2>


<p>William Dunbar was born in 1749 at the celebrated manor
house of Thunderton, near Elgin in Morayshire, Scotland. He
was the youngest son of Sir Archibald Dunbar, who was head
of one of the most ancient and famous earldoms in his native
country.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> After William Dunbar's removal to America, he became
head of this house in Scotland. Although he never assumed
the title which he thus inherited, he is known in the history
of his adopted state as Sir William Dunbar.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>After he had received a liberal education at Glasgow, his
fondness for mathematics and astronomy led him to continue
these studies in London. His health failed in the latter place
and he decided to try his fortune in the New World.</p>

<p>He procured from the great house of Hunter and Bailey,
London, an outfit of goods suitable for trading with the Indians.
He reached Philadelphia in April, 1771, and immediately transported
his goods, to the value of about &pound;1,000, overland to Fort
Pitt (Pittsburg).<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Within two months he had exchanged them
for furs and peltries, which he forwarded to London. He continued
in this business for two years, when he formed a partnership
with John Ross, a prominent Scotch merchant and capitalist
of Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In order to establish a plantation in the British province
of West Florida, Dunbar descended the Ohio and Mississippi
in 1773, and selected a tract of land near Baton Rouge, then
called by the English, New Richmond. He went to Pensacola,
capitol of West Florida, where he received from Governor
Chester permission to settle the tract selected, and thence to
Jamaica, where he bought a large number of slaves, direct from
Africa. With these, he returned to his new home, by way of
Pensacola, the lakes, and the Amite.</p>

<p>He first directed his attention to raising indigo, but soon
found that it was more profitable to manufacture staves for the
West India market. These he exchanged for such commodities
as were demanded by his neighbors along the Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>From a document written in 1773, and found among the
papers of George Chalmers, Secretary of Trade of Great
Britain, we find that at this time there were only thirty-three
settlements east of the Mississippi and between Natchez and
what is now the state of Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> But from that date the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>streams of immigration began to flow steadily into this new
country. This fact is shown by another contemporary manuscript,
which was written by Gov. Chester, shortly after the
Spanish conquest of West Florida. In it he says that in 1778,
"considering the importance of the Western Parts of the Colony
(of West Florida) lying on the River Mississippi which had
so far increased in its inhabitants____that since the____last
Assembly (held in 1772) it had been divided from the District
of Mobile or Charlotte County and erected into Two Districts,
viz.: The District of Manschack and the District of
Natchez and contained a great number of respectable wealthy
Planters and Settlers than either of the other Districts in the
Colony" (Mobile and Pensacola).<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>During the greater part of his first six years' residence
near Baton Rouge, Dunbar suffered from a series of misfortunes
which well-nigh destroyed all that he could accumulate through
his industry and thrift. In 1775, he lost some of his most valuable
slaves through a rebellion in which they were implicated.
Three years later, his house and plantation were plundered by
one Capt. James Willing,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> who, although a commissioned officer
in the continental army was really a freebooter. In speaking
of Willing's visitation, Dunbar says, in his private Journal
that "the houses of the British gentlemen on the English side
were plundered, and among the rest, mine was robbed of everything
that could be carried away&mdash;all my wearing apparel, bed
and table linen; not a shirt was left in the house,&mdash;blankets,
pieces of cloth, sugar, silverware. In short, all was fish that
came in their net____I was plundered of &pound;200 sterling value."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
The year following, 1779, his plantation was again raided,&mdash;this
time by marauding bands of soldiers from the Spanish
army that subdued the district under their gallant leader, Galvez.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>For several years after the last of these misfortunes, Dunbar
was left undisturbed in his pursuits; and by constant application
to business and the adroit management of the affairs of his
firm, he accumulated a competency.</p>

<p>In 1787, he wrote to his partner, Mr. Ross, that the lands at
Natchez were far preferable to their lands at Baton Rouge; that
the Natchez soil was particularly favorable to the production
of tobacco and that there were overseers in that part of the
country who would engage to produce from two to three hogsheads
to the hand besides provisions. His final settlement was
at a place nine miles south of Natchez and four miles east of the
Mississippi River. Here he opened the celebrated plantation
called "The Forest," where he spent the remainder of his life.</p>

<p>On account of the competition from Kentucky and the
Spanish restrictions on trade, he found the cultivation of tobacco
unprofitable. He directed his attention to the raising of
indigo, but was soon forced to abandon this also, because of
the ravages of an insect. He then engaged in the cultivation
of cotton, which proved to be a very remunerative crop. We
are told that he became "the most extensive and successful
planter" in this region, being one of the first to turn the attention
of the planters of the Natchez District to the advantages
which the cultivation of cotton afforded over other crops. In
1799 he wrote to Mr. Ross of Philadelphia that he continued
to cultivate cotton with very great success and that it was by
far the most remunerative staple that had been raised in this
county.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> In another letter, written while in the midst of the
cotton harvest, he said that he had made "not less than 20,000
pounds of clean cotton worth in London &pound;2,000." He also mentioned
that he had helped to improve the method of packing
cotton by the introduction of the square bale. In order to perfect
this improvement, he requested his correspondent to have a
screw press made in Philadelphia according to the specifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
which were enclosed.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> In a subsequent letter written to
the same party, Dunbar expressed his surprise that the press
should have cost him $1,000, but added that he would try "to
indemnify" himself "by extracting an oil from the cotton
seed." He requested to be informed what price such an oil
would bring in the market, stating that it would probably be
classed "between the drying and fat oils, resembling linseed in
color and tenacity, but perhaps less drying."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Claiborne says
that this was "the first suggestion of that product which has now
become a great article of commerce, or indeed of utilizing cotton
seed at all. At that period it was not dreamed of as a fertilizer,
nor fed, in any shape to stock. It was usually burnt or
hauled to a strong enclosure, at a remote part of the farm, to
decompose, and was considered of no use whatever, and really
a nuisance."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>These brief extracts, from the correspondence of Dunbar,
show that he made a practical application of the scientific principles
which he had learned in his native country. No comments
are needed to show that he was a man of thought as well as of
action.</p>

<p>Dunbar continued his business relations with Mr. Ross until
the partnership was dissolved by the death of the latter in
1800. The interest of the heirs of the deceased was then bought
by Mr. Dunbar for about $20,000.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>The remaining years of his life were devoted almost exclusively
to scientific investigations, which he frequently characterized
as his "favorite amusements." He seemed to be indifferent
to political preferment, and though out of deference
to the wishes of his people, he sometimes permitted an interruption
of his scientific work in order to perform the duties of the
offices which were more than once thrust upon him, such labors
were not congenial to him. After the adjournment of the Territorial
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>Legislature in 1803 of which he was a member, he wrote
to President Jefferson expressing his delight upon being able
to return to his scientific work.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>No greater injustice could be done Mr. Dunbar than to infer
that his political indifference was due to lack of patriotism. His
strong attachment to the home of his adoption is shown in the
following extract from a letter to President Jefferson, written
January 7, 1803:&mdash;"By a letter____from my much esteemed
friend, Mrs. Trist,____she says that you had informed her it
was my intention to remove shortly from this country; I beg
leave to remove this impression. Since the country has been
united to the American federation, I have never ceased to consider
it as my own country which I hope never to be under the
necessity of abandoning."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> In another letter, written to the
same great statesman six months later, Dunbar calls attention
to the "renewed activity and immigration of the French to the
Mississippi Valley," and expresses a fear of the consequences
to follow therefrom. "It is desirable," he adds, "to preserve
the whole of the Valley of the Mississippi for the spread of the
people of the United States; who might in the progress of a
century, plant the fine western valley of the Mississippi with
many millions of inhabitants, speaking the same language with
ourselves. It ought not to be objected that this object is too
remote to merit contemplation of the present moment."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> He
then gives a discussion of the political methods of the French
and Spaniards; also his ideas of the reason why the Spaniards
had stopped the right of deposit at New Orleans, with circumstances
to confirm the same.</p>

<p>He closes this letter by saying that politics is not a fa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>vorite
subject with him, and that he would probably not introduce
it again into their correspondence, unless in the view of
communicating something which it might be important for Jefferson
to know. However sincere may have been his intentions
to abstain from writing on political matters, we find that in his
next letter to Jefferson, written about four months later, he
discusses at length the claim of Louisiana to West Florida, and
gives a representation of the political outlook of Mississippi
and of Louisiana.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> In another letter, written three months later
still, he opposes a resolution submitted to Congress "to deprive
Jefferson College of thirty acres of land____and to give the
same to the city of Natchez."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>Dunbar's greatest claim to prominence is based upon the
results of his scientific investigations. His researches in this remote
and then unexplored field of inquiry brought him into
fellowship with the wise and learned of all countries, and gained
for him a reputation wider perhaps than that of any other
scientist in the history of the State. Col. Claiborne, writing
in 1876, said of him that he "was not only the most learned man
of his time on the Mississippi, but we have had no man his
equal since."<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Dunbar's fondness for mathematics and astronomy
made him the friend and correspondent of Sir William
Herschel. He also numbered among his correspondents some
of the foremost scientists of his time,&mdash;Hunter, Bartram, Rittenhouse,
and Rush.</p>

<p>During the latter part of the Spanish rule, he was appointed
Surveyor General of the District of Natchez. He also served
as a representative of the Spanish government in locating the
31&deg; of North Latitude, which was established as the boundary
line between the United States and the Spanish possessions east
of the Mississippi. As he was never a subject of his Catholic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>Majesty,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> these services were strictly professional. The relationship
between him and Governor Gayoso was, however, very
cordial, as is shown by their correspondence.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Upon one occasion,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
Dunbar presented Gayoso with a costly sextant, which
the latter needed in order to complete a course of astronomical
observations upon which he was engaged. At another time<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Gayoso had cause to thank Dunbar for the use of a "famous
astronomical circle" belonging to the latter. Gayoso says of
this instrument, "it surpassed my expectation,____. Every
part is so delicately finished and solidly supported &amp; so well
prepared to be adjusted that it would give me courage to make
an observation myself. If the instrument was not your own
property I would have advised you to make a voyage to admire
it. Now I think with your assistance I may with confidence
and decency proceed to the demarcation of the Line as soon as
I receive orders for the purpose." The sickness of Mr. Dunbar
about this time was a source of great concern to Gayoso. In a
third letter<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> upon this subject, written two weeks before the
work upon the line began, Gayoso expressed some apprehension
that, for his sake, Dunbar might imprudently expose himself.
When Dunbar was at work upon the line, Gayoso wrote to him
as follows: "I congratulate myself for having had the opportunity
of meeting with a person so well calculated to fulfill so
important a charge for which is required science with every
other quality worthy of public trust; you possess them all in a
degree to do honor to any country; these are my sincere sentiments."</p>

<p>Dunbar's services on the line of demarcation extended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>from May 26 to August 28, 1798, the time consumed in surveying
the first eighteen miles of the boundary.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The preliminary
observations leading to the location of the 31&deg; were made in
his private observatory on Union Hill.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> An inundation of the
Mississippi prevented the survey from beginning at the bank
of the river. The water having receded by the 28th of July,
Dunbar began to extend the line to the river from the point of
starting, while Ellicott, the American Commissioner, continued
his survey to the east.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Through this swamp, which was found
to be 2111.42 French toises or 2 miles and 186 perches English
measure, a trace sixty feet wide was cut to designate the
boundary, and posts were put at intervals of a mile.</p>

<p>Dunbar rejoined the American Commissioners on August
20. A few days later he made the following entry in his report
to the Spanish government:&mdash;"I set out on the 31st day
of August bidding a final adieu to the Gentlemen of both Commissions,
with whom I had spent three months in a manner
highly agreeable to my own taste, and with uninterrupted harmony
on my part with every gentleman of both parties, and
had it not been that my family and other interests demanded
my protection and superintendence, I should have with pleasure
pursued this employment to its conclusion."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Ellicott, in his
report of this survey, published in the Transactions of the American
Philosophical Society, says:&mdash;"To William Dunbar, Esq.,
of the Mississippi Territory I feel myself under the greatest
obligations for his assistance during the short time he was with
us; his extensive scientific acquirements, added to a singular
facility in making calculations would have reduced my labour
to a mere amusement, if he had continued."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> The same writer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>in his Journal, published in Philadelphia, five years after his
association with Dunbar, says that he is "a gentleman whose
extensive information and scientific acquirements would give
him a distinguished rank in any place or in any country."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Since Ellicott himself was one of the foremost scientists of his
time in this country<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the value of his estimate of Dunbar cannot
be questioned.</p>

<p>A few months after the completion of this important public
survey, Daniel Clarke wrote a letter to Thomas Jefferson, in
which he referred to Dunbar as "a person worthy of being consulted____on
subjects relating to this Country its productions,
or any philosophical Question connected with them____For
Science, Probity &amp; general information (he) is the first Character
in this part of the World. His long residence in this
Country, still but little known to men of letters, its Situation
with respect to many Savage tribes, some of which lately inhabited
the very Place where he resides &amp; where their visages
are still perceptible, the extensive Communications with remote
parts presented by the Mississippi and concourse of Indians &amp;
traders, have given him many opportunities of making observations
which may not have presented themselves to others and
may not probably occur in future, to these may be added those
he has made on the Country itself, its population, manners,
Customs of the Inhabitants, the different Changes in their
Government for the last 40 years, the Climate, soil &amp; Trade
which are but little known abroad."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The manuscript correspondence of Thomas Jefferson, in
the Archives of the Department of State at Washington shows
that he acted upon this suggestion from Mr Clarke. In this
collection there have been preserved fifteen letters that were
written by Dunbar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of these in chronological order, bears the date of
July 15, 1800. It states briefly that in compliance with the request
of a friend in London, Dunbar had prepared certain
notes and remarks "made while upon the line of Demarcation."
These he sent to Jefferson with a request that after reading he
forward them to London. Jefferson, who was then President
of the American Philosophical Society and a great patron of
science, was so favorably impressed by these notes that instead
of forwarding them as directed, he sent them to Dr. Wistar of
Philadelphia with a recommendation that Dunbar be elected to
membership in the Philosophical Society. On this point Jefferson
wrote that he had proposed so many members at different
times that he was afraid to add to the number. "Yet,"
says he, "Dunbar ought to be associated to us. I enclose you a
letter with communications of his to Mr. Smith of London which
____will enable you to judge of his degree of science, &amp; therefore,
I leave them open for your perusal, &amp; will pray you to
seal &amp; send them____to London." Shortly after this Dunbar
was elected to membership in this, the most celebrated organization
of scientists in the early history of the United States. The
fact that only thirteen other Americans were added to this body
during the three years from January 1st, 1799 to 1802, gives a
proper estimate of the high honor conferred upon Mr. Dunbar.
In writing to Dunbar, shortly after this recognition of his
scientific attainments, Ellicott says: "If you do justice to your
own abilities and observations, you will do credit to the society
by your communications."</p>

<p>Before considering the character and extent of his subsequent
contributions to science, the notes and remarks referred
to above demand consideration. These are contained in his report
of the survey to his Catholic Majesty,<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> the Spanish copy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
of which is in the archives at Madrid. Several years ago it was
examined by Alexander Everett, who often referred to it as "a
document of rare science and accuracy."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>It consists of two parts. The first treats of the mathematical
calculations and the astronomical observations made in locating
the 31&deg; of latitude and in surveying the first eighteen miles
of the line of demarcation. The remainder consists of notes
taken at his encampment on the Bluff, in August, 1798. These
treat, for the most part, of the vegetable and animal life to be
found along the line of the survey, particularly in the swamp
of the Mississippi river.</p>

<p>He makes several interesting observations on the red and
the white cypress, the former of which he says is the more valuable
for strength and durability, owing to its being impregnated
with resin. He also observes that the "cypress knees," as they
are commonly called, never reach a height greater than the high
water mark. In combating the theory of Dupratz that the cypress
is propagated from its root, Dunbar says that is "invariably
propagated from the seed, which is about the size of a
Spanish walnut," and that he has "often observed half a dozen
or more young plants produced from one apple, which often
coalesce into one and sometimes the greater part perish to make
room for their more fortunate brethren." He says of one
species of the white oak, that "nature has so ordained that the
husk embraces the acorn so firmly that they are not separated
by their fall from the tree, by which means this case by its comparatively
small specific gravity buoys up the acorn, and being
carried along by the various current of the inundation, serves to
plant distant colonies of this species." He also gives an interesting
account of the cotton tree, the willow and the bamboo cane,
the last of which he attempts to classify botanically. He says
of the cane: "It produces a very abundant crop of grain, and
that only once, for it immediately after perishes, root and
branch, it is not known how many years the reed requires to
arrive at this state of maturity; if we were to suppose that 25<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
years were its limit, it must happen that a person who has resided
during that length of time in this country and who has
visited many parts of it must have seen all the cane that came
under his inspection once in grain, and upon the average one
twenty-fifth part of all the cane in a large tract of country
ought annually to yield a crop, but this is by no means the
case, for I who have lived during that length of time in this
country and have frequently traversed many extensive tracts
of it, have never in any one year seen 1-500 part of the canes
in seed of those parts that I have intimately known." He
therefore concludes that it must require at least five hundred
years for this plant to reach "a state of maturity to enable it
to bear a crop of seed."</p>

<p>His description of the ornamental trees of this region is
graphic and interesting. No one can read his account of the
magnolia tree without being deeply impressed with the fact that
he appreciated its beauty. In studying the properties of the
poplar, he made a hydrometer of a thin, broad piece of plank
of this material, cut across the grain. He "improved its sensibility
by boiling it when very dry, in a solution of mild alkali
or carbonated potash." He describes many other trees, among
which are the dogwood, the redbud, the wild cherry, the horse
chestnut and the sweet gum.</p>

<p>He records the observation of a very rare phenomenon,
which he saw August 12th, when engaged upon this work. It
was a rainbow that consisted of more than a semi-circle, "the
vertical point" of which "did not seem more than 8 feet from
the eye, although the inferior parts seemed farther removed,
which produced an optical deception by giving it the appearance
of an ellipsis, the transverse diameter being parallel to the
horizon; this perhaps is the first natural rainbow exceeding a
semi-circle which has been seen by a human eye, because to produce
such an effect from the general idea formed of this phenomenon,
the sun ought to be in the horizon to cause the appearance
of a full semi-circle exceeded only by the parallactic angle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
of the elevation of the eye above the base of the rainbow, which
must generally be insensible; the above effect however is easily
accounted for on Newton's principles<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> from the peculiar circumstances
in which I was placed."</p>

<p>He says that the microscope reveals in the water of this part
of the country the same varieties of animalcul&aelig; which he had
often examined in Europe and many new ones, which he does not
remember to have seen described by any writer, and which he
hopes to find leisure to describe at some future day.</p>

<p>After giving a brief account of some of the wild animals,
reptiles, fish, and birds of this country, he concludes with lists
of the "vegetable productions of the Swampy Grounds or such
as are much exposed to the Annual Inundation;" the "most remarkable
vegetable productions of the high lands;" and the
"Trees and Plants cultivated by the Inhabitants of the Mississippi
territory and by those of the adjoining Spanish Provinces."</p>

<p>As has been noted above, the last ten years of Dunbar's life
were devoted almost entirely to scientific research. The value of
his contributions to knowledge was widely recognized, and "The
Forest" became familiar to the scientific world, though it was
sometimes incorrectly placed in Louisiana.</p>

<p>Volume V. of the Transactions of the American Philosophical
Society, published in Philadelphia in 1801, contains three
articles from his pen, and Volume VI. of the same publication,
issued eight years later, contains twelve, one of which was translated
into the German and appeared in Gilbert's Annalen of
Physics, vol. 31,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> published in Leipzig in 1809. To this latter
volume of the Transactions Andrew Ellicott contributed nine
articles, Jose Joaquin de Ferrer, eight, Dr. Benjamin Smith
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>Barton, five, Benj. Henry Latrobe, three, and Dr. Joseph
Priestly, F. R. S., three, while to repeat Dunbar contributed
twelve. This shows that Dunbar was at that time one of the most
active investigators on the continent.</p>

<p>His contributions to the Transactions and his correspondence
with Jefferson give a conception of the character and extent
to his investigations. The first of these contributions was
written June 30, 1800, and treats of the "Language of Signs
among certain North American Indians." In this he traces
certain points of analogy "between the Chinese written language
and our Western language of signs." In both, says he, there are
certain "roots of language in which every other word or species
in a systematic sense is referred to its proper genus or root."
He gives, for example, the sign for water which is a genus and
shows that rain, snow, ice, hail, hoar-frost, dew, etc., are species
represented by signs more or less complex, retaining always the
root or genus as the basis of the compound sign. He adduces
other interesting facts from this study of the subject, which cannot
be given in this connection.</p>

<p>His Meteorological Observations for 1799, gives unmistakable
evidence of his devotion to science. It shows that three times
a day, each day in the year, he recorded the temperature and
the barometric readings; also the direction and strength of the
winds with the state of the weather, and the amount of rainfall
together with remarks about the state of the vegetation from
time to time. To this he adds a Recapitulation, giving the greatest,
the lowest, and the mean points of the thermometer and the
barometer, and the amount of rainfall for each month and then
for the whole year. The Editor of the publication states in a
footnote that "the society have been induced to publish this
journal <i>entire</i>, as it is certainly the first that has been kept with
so much accuracy and attention in that part of the world, and
may serve as a standard with which to compare future observations."</p>

<p>In another article, Dunbar gives a "Description of a singular
phenomenon seen at Baton Rouge" in the spring of 1800.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>His fourth contribution consists in extracts from a letter
dated Aug. 22, 1801, which he wrote to Jefferson, relative "to
fossil bones found in Louisiana, and to Lunar Rainbows observed
West of the Mississippi." In this letter, he referred to an account
of "Dr. Hooks' scheme of a telegraphy, in the year 1684,"
which he intended to transmit to Jefferson, but found himself
anticipated in that communication by a paper in the first volume
of the London Philosophical Magazine. He also directs Jefferson's
attention to "a certain phenomenon at sunset,"&mdash;the yellow
orange color of the Eastern clouds, which ascends as the
sun descends&mdash;upon which he makes certain observations and explanations,
and suggestions for further investigations by philosophers.</p>

<p>With this letter there was enclosed a fifth contribution to
the Transactions. This article is entitled, "Meteorological Observations
made by William Dunbar, Esq., at the Forest, four miles
east of the Mississippi, in Latitude 31&deg; 28&acute; North, and in Longitude
91&deg; 30&acute; west of Greenwich, for the year 1800; with remarks
on the state of the winds, weather, vegetation, etc., calculated to
give some idea of the climate of the country." In this article he
says, "the frequent and rapid changes in the state of the weather
in this climate furnish an excellent opportunity of verifying
the vulgar opinion of the moon's pretended influence at her
conjunctions, oppositions and quadratures; but truth compels
me to say (what probably may be said of many similar persuasions)
that after a continued and scrupulous attention to this
object, I have not discovered any such regularity of coincidences,
which might justify the reverence with which those traditional
maxims are at this day received." After discussing a method of
manufacturing ice by artificial means, he concludes this communication
with the following observations on the storms of the
Gulf Coast region: "It is evident that the circular course of the
vortex followed that of the sun's apparent diurnal motion.&mdash;It
is possible that if similar observations are made upon all hurricanes,
tornadoes and whirlwinds they will be found universally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
to consist of a vortex with a central spot in a state of profound
calm."</p>

<p>Dunbar's next letter that is preserved in the Jefferson
Papers is one to John Vaughan bearing the date of March 21,
1802. In this the writer says that he envies Vaughan's "happiness
at the discovery of a complete skeleton of a mammoth." He
makes some observations on the species to which this mammoth
belongs and refers to recent discoveries of a similar nature in
the interior of Asia and Borneo. He gives the results of recent
geological observations on the nature of the soil and the stratification
of the same as shown by the banks of the Mississippi at
Natchez; also a discussion of stones, rocks, ores, mineral waters,
petrifaction, etc. He requests Vaughan to inform Dr. Bartram
that since writing him last, he has made several new discoveries
of a botanical and zoological nature which he here describes.</p>

<p>This letter also shows that Dunbar was one of the first
Mississippians to resort to inoculation for protection against
small-pox. He asked Vaughan to send him some fresh vaccine
virus and stated that six children in his own family had never
"had that disease, besides a lengthy list of Black people, both
young and old." Vaughan complied with this request by sending
the virus and asked Jefferson to do likewise, stating that "the
Vaccine inoculation gathers strength hourly, <i>no</i> respectable
practitioner (of Philadelphia) opposes it."</p>

<p>January 15, 1803 Dunbar wrote to Jefferson: "Bad health
which has endured above twelve months has withheld much of
my attention from Philosophic objects, a favorable change having
lately taken place, I perceive with satisfaction that my mind
and body are both recovering their former tone and now again
enjoy the pleasing prospect of dedicating my leisure hours to
my favorite amusements."</p>

<p>Dunbar's next contribution to the Transactions was entitled,
"Abstract of a communication from Mr. Martin Durale, relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
to fossil bones, etc., of the County of Opelousas, west of the
Mississippi to Mr. William Dunbar of the Natchez," etc. In this
account Dunbar, in referring to certain phenomena makes use
of the following expression, which has characterized the true
philosophers of all ages, "I have never observed them without
endeavoring to ascertain the cause of them."</p>

<p>This communication was accompanied by "pretty full vocabularies
of the tongues of two Indian nations of that country,"
to which "was added a sketch of the religion or superstition of
these people." In this connection, Dunbar says, "From several
other quarters I have used some efforts to draw similar information,
but am hitherto disappointed." He also makes mention of
a letter which he had just received from Sir Joseph Banks with
an extract from the Transactions of the Royal Society.</p>

<p>January 28, 1804, Dunbar wrote to Jefferson transmitting
his seventh and eighth contributions to Volume Six of the Transactions,
while an extract from his letter was published as a ninth
contribution. His seventh article was entitled a "Description of
the river Mississippi and its Delta, with that of the adjacent
parts of Louisiana." In this he gives a table of the mean altitude
of the waters of the Mississippi at Natchez, from the lowest ebb
to the highest elevation for the first and fifteenth of each month
in the year. It also contains a good account of overflows and
some philosophical reflections on the velocity, banks, currents,
deposits and depth of the river and the effects of confining it to
its channel. In speaking of the overflow lands he says, "although
no successful attempt is likely to be made in our day, yet
posterity will reclaim" them. He discusses the methods used in
Holland and in Egypt, and makes several speculations as to the
method that will probably be successful. This sketch, he says, in
conclusion, "is the result of occasional observation for a series
of years and of scattered information collected from various
sources, probably often uncertain, from a cause which is unfortunately,
too general; viz: the extreme inattention of persons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
even of some education to the most curious phenomena passing
daily under their review."</p>

<p>The eighth article was entitled: "Monthly and Annual Results
of Meteorological Observations" for the years 1801, 1802,
1803.</p>

<p>In an appendix to his seventh article, he discusses the writings
of certain Italian, French and German scientists, giving
his reasons for differing with them on certain philosophical
questions. His discussion is devoted largely to a consideration
of certain laws of hydrostatics.</p>

<p>His "Observations on the eclipse of the sun, June 16, 1806"
made in his private observatory on Union Hill, constitutes his
tenth contribution to the publication mentioned above. This article
gives a vivid account of the excited state of mind with
which an astronomer awaits the time when nature affords favorable
opportunities for investigating her mysteries. It also shows
that this frontier scientist of Mississippi enjoyed in thought, as
he could not by personal association, the companionship of the
great thinkers of the world. These are his words:</p>

<p>"The moment of the expected impression approached and reflecting
that this eclipse was to be seen all over Europe and North
America which renders it a very important phenomenon for
settling comparative longitudes, I conceived that all the zealous
astronomers of both worlds were then looking with me at the
great luminary and centre of our system. I kept my eye riveted
upon that point of the disk where the eclipse was to commence,
with an anxiety known only to astronomers; with the chronometer
watch at my ear, I attended to the most doubtful appearances
which my perturbation perhaps presented to the eye, and
upon every alarm, began to count the beats of the watch (five in
two seconds) in order that I might not lose the very first instant
of the impression, and I am confident that not one quarter
of a second was lost."</p>

<p>The last letter that has been preserved from the interesting
correspondence between Dunbar and Jefferson, bears the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
date of Dec. 17, 1805. With it was enclosed Dunbar's "Method
of finding the Longitude by a single observer without any knowledge
of the precise time," a problem that had been solved by
him at Jefferson's request. This formed an eleventh contribution
to the publication referred to above.</p>

<p>There is no reason for doubting that this correspondence
was continued throughout the remaining four years of Dunbar's
life, though the letters have not been found by the writer.</p>

<p>Dunbar's last contribution to the Transactions was entitled:
"Observations on the Comet of 1807-'8." It was read before the
Society Nov. 18, 1808. In this article appears at least one entry
which indicated that the scientific services of its author were
drawing to a close. "Indisposition," says he at one point in the
narrative, "prevented observation for some time past." A few
months from this date the scientific investigation of this remarkable
man were brought to a close.</p>

<p>Writers have frequently noted the fact that many great men
have lived in advance of their times. To substantiate this assertion
they cite us to the careers of Copernicus, Galileo, Newton,
and a host of others. That Dunbar is entitled to the same distinction
might be amply proved by a study of his life.</p>

<p>The most conclusive evidence of this fact is furnished by
his idea of the relation the government should sustain to scientific
explorations. In a letter to John Vaughan, bearing the date
of March 21, 1802, he writes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is no example of any encouragement being held out
by [our] Government; no spirit of inquiry set on foot at the
public expense. What is the reason, we have no State observatory
to which individuals might send their contributions &amp; from
which they might receive astronomical intelligence.... No
naturalist travels at the public expense to explore our immense
country &amp; make us acquainted with the infinite resources it Contains
upon its surface, in its waters &amp; within its bowels, from
whence great national advantages would result; the public &amp;
individuals would be instructed where to direct their researches
after such objects as might become subjects of curiosity, Public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the exercise of genius &amp; agrandizem't of fortune; but it would
seem that the speculations ... of our politicians are confined
within the narrow circle of the Customs &amp; Excise, while literature
of our present illustrious President will correct &amp; enlarge
the views of our public men, &amp; that under his auspices &amp; protection,
Arts, Science, &amp; Literature may take a flight, which
will at length carry them beyond those European brethren, as
wel[l] to[o] as above them in the enjoyment of national liberty."</p></div>

<p>In transmitting this letter to Jefferson, Vaughan says of
Dunbar, "he is like yourself a warm friend to the encouragement of
Science and letters, it would be fortunate for the country,
if these ideas became more prevalent."</p>

<p>Remarkable to relate, two years had not elapsed after Dunbar
had written this despondent letter before he saw evidences
of a partial fulfillment of his desire and three months later
still, he was appointed a member of one of the first expeditions
sent out for scientific purposes at the expense of the government
of the United States. In a letter to President Jefferson, written
May 13, 1804, Dunbar says: "The surveying and exploring expeditions
to be undertaken at public expense must be most gratifying
to all lovers of science and natural research.... It will
give me the highest satisfaction to contribute everything in my
power to promote the proposed expedition on the Red and Arcansa
Rivers."</p>

<p>Owing to the dissentions among the Osage Indians, the
main part of this expedition was postponed, however, until the
spring of 1805. In a letter bearing the date of July 14, 1804,
Jefferson wrote to Dunbar:&mdash;"It is very desirable that you make
use of any part of the men or matters provided for the expedition
and go to what distance, and in what direction you please,
return when you please, but in time to report to us the result
of your researches, which report will probably induce Congress
to enlarge the appropriation."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>
<p>August 18, 1804 he wrote Jefferson that, "in consequence of
the permission you are pleased to grant, I have determined to
make an excursion up the Washita river and to the hot springs."
Two months later, he wrote that he had about completed the
necessary preparations for the expedition and that he would
carry "several instruments [of his own] in addition to those provided
for the party" by the government. Three weeks after
writing the above letter, he again wrote to the President from
the Post of Washita giving him the latitude of the most important
points on the river.</p>

<p>After his return to Natchez, he wrote Jefferson the first
scientific account of the water at Hot Springs. Subsequent analyses
of this water have shown some inaccuracies in this account,
but it must be remembered that Dunbar was only a pioneer
in this important field. His account reads as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have examined the water at 130&deg; Fahrenheit under a
powerful microscope and found vegetable and animal life, the
former a species of moss, the latter a testaceous bivalve of the
size of the minutest grain of sand. I do not despair of being
able to reanimate these as soon as I can procure a little leisure....<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
From our analysis of the water ... it appears to contain
lime with a minute portion of iron dissolved by a small excess
of Carbonic acid. This is ... visible upon the first view of the
Springs; an immense body of calcareous matter is accumulated
upon the side of the hill, by perpetual deposits from the hot
waters, and the bed of the run is coloured red oxide of iron or
rather Carbonated iron. Every little spring which rises up in a
favorable situation forms its own calcareous cup considerably
elevated in form of a crater."</p></div>

<p>The following year (1805) Dunbar was given the general
supervision of the Red River Expedition. May 24 of that year
Mr. Dearborn, the Secretary of War, wrote requesting him to
make all arrangements for this expedition, limiting the expenses
to $5,000. In a letter bearing the date of March 30, 1807, Mr.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>
<p>Dearborn expressed his appreciation of Mr. Dunbar's services
in the following words:&mdash;"The frequent drafts on account of
the United States upon your time and patience demand an apology,
while your disinterestedness and highly useful services entitle
you to the most grateful acknowledgements."</p>

<p>Dunbar's idea of the relation the government should sustain
to scientific research is still further set forth in his last
letter that has been preserved in the Jefferson manuscripts.
From this letter, which bears the date of December 17, 1805, the
following extract is taken:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have just received from London a six feet Gregorian
reflecting Telescope with six magnifying powers from 110 to
550 times; hitherto from a liberal construction of the act of
Congress, by the Collectors of the Mississippi Territory residing
at Fort Adams, I have been in the habit of receiving books and
instruments free of duty, but Mr. Browne at New Orleans is so
rigidly faithful as a public servant that he admits of no exemptions
neither in favor of the Mississippi Society, for which I have
lately imported a chest of books; nor in favor of this valuable
instrument, the cost of which in London was about 150 guineas,
[about $750]. I suppose Mr. Browne is quite correct as to the
letter of the law.... I have just sent off an order for Mr.
Briggs, Mr. Dinsmore and myself, for astronomical instruments
&amp; chronometers to the amount of 300 guineas [about $1,500],
all of which as well as that just received, will in some shape be
applied to public use and benefit &amp; might therefore be entitled
to a claim upon public indulgence."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>
<p>The significance of this extract is twofold. It shows that
Dunbar devoted his time to scientific investigation not only to
gratify himself but to serve the public. His love of science for its
own sake made "favorite amusements" of labors that would
otherwise have been very onerous. His desire to benefit others
through these investigations led him to fulfill that true test of
all greatness,&mdash;service to one's fellow-man. This extract shows
further the contagion of an enthusiastic devotion to a great
cause. Dunbar and his friends, remote from the intellectual centers
of the world, constituted themselves into a society, which
spent a larger sum of money for scientific purposes than perhaps
any other private scientific organization in the history of the
State. He sought the co-operation of all thinking men with whom
he came in contact. He was active in his efforts to collect all facts
of scientific interest throughout his part of the country. That
he was often disappointed in these efforts, is shown by more
than one passage in his writings. In his "Description of the
Mississippi and its Delta" he expresses his regret over "the
extreme inattention of persons, even of some education, to the
most curious phenomena passing daily under their review."</p>

<p>Philip Nolan, the dauntless hero of one of Edward Everett
Hale's most interesting stories,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was a warm personal friend of
Dunbar and was often mentioned in the Jefferson correspondence
in the most complimentary terms. This relationship was
probably due to the fact that Nolan had a remarkably wide range<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
of information gathered from the remote western wilds and he
took pleasure in imparting the results of his observations to
Dunbar.</p>

<p>He was a warm friend to all students of nature. Only a few
months before his death, he had the pleasure of entertaining in
his own home, "the Father of American Ornithology," Alexander
Wilson. Upon hearing that Wilson was in Natchez, Dunbar
wrote him the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

<span class="smcap">Forest</span>, 20th May, 1810.<br />
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>:&mdash;It is very unfortunate that I should be so much
indisposed as to be confined to my bedroom; nevertheless I cannot
give up the idea of having the pleasure of seeing you as
soon as you find it convenient; the perusal of your first volume
of Ornithology, lent me by General Wilkinson, has produced in
me a very great desire of making your acquaintance.</p>

<p>"I understand, from my boy, that you propose going in a
few days to New Orleans, where you will see some small cabinets
of natural history that may interest you. But as I presume it is
your intention to prosecute your inquiries into the interior of our
country, this cannot be done better than from my house, as your
headquarters; where everything will be made convenient to your
wishes. My house stands literally in the forest, and your beautiful
orioles with other elegant birds, are our courtyard companions.</p>

<p>"The bearer attends you, with a couple of horses, on the
supposition that it may be convenient for you to visit us today;
otherwise he shall wait upon you any other day that you shall
appoint.</p>

<p class="center">                       "I am respectfully, &amp;c.,
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">William Dunbar</span>."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In writing of this visit, Wilson says in his Journal:&mdash;"I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
was received with great hospitality and kindness, had a neat
bedroom assigned me; and was requested to consider myself
as at home during the time I should find it convenient to stay in
exploring this part of the country." In his great work on Ornithology
he acknowledges the assistance of Dunbar in securing
two or three new species of birds. He also refers to Dunbar as a
man "whose life has been devoted to science," and he says "the
few happy days I spent there [at 'The Forest'] I shall never
forget."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> In writing to Dr. Bartram from Philadelphia, Sept.
2, 1810, Wilson says, "Mr. Dunbar of Natchez, remembered you
very well, and desired me to carry his good wishes to you."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>The most prominent trait of Dunbar's character was his
love of nature. He admired her in all of her manifestations. She
was attractive to him not only because of her beauty but because
of her mysteries. With the spirit of a true philosopher, he ever
inquired into the laws which regulated her actions. To paraphrase
slightly his own language, he never observed any phenomena
without endeavoring to ascertain the cause of them.
He did not read at random, pages from the great book of nature,
but read as continuously as circumstances would permit. He
read it in the howling wind, the turbid current, the trembling
needle, the growing plant, the blazing comet, the silent stone, the
lifeless fossil. He read it critically; he read it appreciatively.
That he often raised his eyes from the well-conned pages of this
great book to fix them on the omniscient Author himself is shown
in more than one passage from his writings.</p>

<p>The career of this great pioneer scientist of Mississippi
ended in the month of October, 1810. Although he was then in
his sixty-first year, his work was incomplete and his plans but
partially executed. In the words of Pliny, "The hand of death
is ... too severe, and too sudden, when it falls upon such as
are employed in some immortal work. The sons of sensuality,
who have no other views beyond the present hour, terminate
with each day the whole purpose of their lives; but those who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>look forward to posterity, and endeavor to extend their memories
to future generations by useful labors:&mdash;to such death is
always immature, as it still snatches them from amidst some unfinished
design."</p>

<p>The permanent results of Dunbar's life-work may be summarized
as follows:</p>


<ul><li>1. He helped to locate and to survey part of the present</li>
<li>boundary line between Mississippi and Louisiana.</li>

<li>2. He first directed the attention of the world to the manufacture</li>
<li>of cotton-seed oil.</li>

<li>3. He invented the screw press for packing cotton, and</li>
<li>helped to perfect the process of packing it in square bales.</li>

<li>4. He made the first accurate meteorological observations</li>
<li>in the valley of the Mississippi.</li>

<li>5. He made a critical scientific study of the Mississippi</li>
<li>River and its Delta.</li>

<li>6. He made important contributions to geographical knowledge,</li>
<li>by determining the latitude and the longitude of many</li>
<li>places.</li>

<li>7. He was the first to give a scientific account of the Hot</li>
<li>Springs and an analysis of its water.</li>

<h2>HISTORY OF TAXATION IN MISSISSIPPI.<br />

CHARLES HILLMAN BROUGH, PH. D. (JOHNS HOPKINS)</h2>


<p>The history of fiscal legislation and development in Mississippi
has five distinct phases and is therefore comprised within
the compass of five distinct periods. These periods, with rough
chronological indices for each, are: (1) Territorial (1798-1817);
(2) Transitional (1817-1861); (3) Confederate and Post-Confederate
Governments (1861-1867); (4) Reconstruction (1867-1876);
(5) Modern (1876-1898).</p>

<p>By an act of Congress approved April 7, 1798, all that tract
of land which today includes the States of Mississippi and
Alabama, was constituted one district and called the "Mississippi
Territory." Major Winthrop Sargent, a native of Massachusetts,
was appointed governor and judges were empowered
to frame a code of laws for the Territory, to be drawn from
the statutes of other States. This code, known as "Sargent's
Code" has been characterized by an able political writer as
"directly at variance with all Statute law in America, and utterly
repugnant to any known system of jurisprudence derived
from the common law of England."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> Certainly this is true of
that part of it "directing the manner in which Money shall be
Raised and Levied to defray the charges which may arise within
the Several Counties."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> According to its provisions, the court
of general quarter sessions in each county was authorized to
make an estimate of the county's average annual expenditure,
the estimate to be submitted to the governor and one or more of
the territorial judges for approval. The amount approved was
then apportioned among the several towns within the county by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>commissioners biennially appointed by the court of common
pleas. If the town numbered sixty or more free citizens, two
commissions were appointed; if one hundred or more, three commissioners.
These commissioners received the returns of taxables
in each township, and assessed the property therein. It was
specified that the commissioners should ascertain "the names of
all free men, inmates, hired male servants (being twenty-one
years of age) and whether profitable or chargeable to the employers"
* * * and obtain "a list of all lands not being
the property of the United States or appropriated to public uses,
the tenements, houses, cabins or other buildings wherein people
dwell and which are rented and afford an income to the owners,
and all ferries, stores, shops, warehouses, mills, gins, keel or
batteaux, boats of the burthen of twenty barrels and upward
producing a yearly income, and of the bound male servants and
male slaves above the age of sixteen and not exceeding fifty;
draught oxen, saddle and draught horses, cows penned or kept
up and immediately productive to the owners; together with the
stock cattle, including sheep and swine intended for market and
thereby productive of annual income and profit."</p>

<p>Lands were assessed "in just proportion to their value,"
with special regard to their annual profit, and no one having
visible property less than one dollar per head annually, save
by a due proportion of labor in the opening and keeping in repair
highways and public roads. This enumeration, viewed in
the light of modern interpretation, virtually means a graduated
income tax applied to town and county government. The valuation
of real estate was determined, not by its intrinsic worth or
actual selling value, but by the annual income [profit] which, on
the average, it was deemed likely to produce. Taxation was altogether
local, there being no territorial levy as distinguished
from the biennial county and township levies. This localization
of fiscal activity, an income [profit] valuation, and the fact that
visible specific property bore all, or nearly all the burden of tax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>ation,
are thus the most striking characteristics of Mississippi's
primitive scheme of taxation.</p>

<p>The collection of taxes was vested in the sheriff, who was
<i>ex-officio</i> the county collector, as he is today. This officer had
powers of imprisonment and distraint. The commissioners appointed
by the County Court as assessors were allowed $1 per
day, and the sheriffs were authorized to keep 1% of their collections
before making their reports to the county treasurers.</p>

<p>This crude fiscal system devised by Sargent remained in
effect without substantial modification until 1815. In that year
a law was passed providing for a distinct territorial tax and
specifying that county taxes should be levied upon the same
property and objects enumerated as were within the territorial
schedule.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> County taxes, however, could not exceed one-half of
the territorial tax. Henceforth, there was to be commonwealth
taxation, as distinguished from purely local taxation. The territorial
schedule comprised a general list of ratable objects with
fixed valuations. Land was divided into six classes, each class
having three qualities. The bases of classification were proximity
to the city of Natchez and distance from the Mississippi, Chickasawhay
and Tombigbee Rivers. Thus, class number one contained
all lands lying within eight miles of the city of Natchez, the
first quality of which was rated at $12 per acre; the second, at
$8; and the third, at $3. Class number two contained all land
lying within fourteen miles of the Mississippi River, with valuations
according to quality ranging from $2 to $7. In short,
valuations decreased in proportion as the distances from commercial
centres and water courses increased; lands, lots and
buildings within any city, borough or town were subject to a
uniform ad valorem tax of 2 mills; and merchandise and bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
stock, to an ad valorem tax of 2&frac12; mills. Capitation taxes of 50
and 62&frac12; cents respectively were levied on each slave and free
white male above the age of twenty-one. Slave traders were taxed
$5.00 on each slave imported into the Territory, a tax containing
the germs of the privilege license system. The schedule
was further strengthened by a tax of $1.25 on every pleasurable
carriage.</p>

<p>It was provided that assessing and collecting officers were
to be appointed by the Governor, rather than by the County
Court, as heretofore&mdash;a change probably due to the differentiation
between commonwealth and county taxation.</p>

<p>We may, for the lack of a better designation, call the period
from 1817, the date of Mississippi's admission into the Union,
to the outbreak of the Civil War, the period of ante-bellum
Statehood. Such a division in fiscal history would seem to be perfectly
artificial, yet it is justified by the fact that during this
period the tax system of the State underwent substantial change.
The increased expenses of State administration, an accumulation
of State indebtedness, minuter differentiation in industry,
giving rise to more numerous classes of wealth and progress in
democratic thought&mdash;all demanded an extension of the State's
fiscal system.</p>

<p>Personal property became as important an object of taxation
as real property. The personal property list was no longer
limited to slaves, pleasure carriages, moneys arising from the
sale of merchandise, and bank stock, but also included gold and
silver plate, pianos, weapons, watches or clocks, cattle in excess
of twenty head, saddle and carriage horses, merchants' and
brokers' capital and money loaned at interest.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>This taxation of personal property, usually rated, was supplemented
by the privilege license system, with charges partly
rated and partly apportioned. Thus, in 1857 auctioneers and
peddlers were taxed 3 per cent. on the amount of their sales;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
saloon-keepers, one-fourth of one per cent. on all sales of vinous
and spirituous liquors by the gallon; trading in slaves, horses
and mules, 3 per cent. on the amount of their sales; keepers
of ferries, toll bridges or turnpikes, one-fourth of one per cent.
on all receipts; circuses $25 for each day's performance; nine-pin
alleys or any like contrivance, $25 each; theatres or places
for theatrical performances, $35 each. Even the poll tax was
widened into its application so as to include free negro as well as
free white males between the ages of twenty-one and fifty years.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with this external expansion, the tax
system of the State underwent internal changes. Land classifications
were abolished, and annual income was rejected as a device
of valuation.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> A method was substituted which is in vogue today,
viz: Assessment according to intrinsic value, to be determined
by the owner or person in charge on oath, taking into consideration
improvements, proximity to navigation, towns, cities, villages
or roads, and any other circumstances that may tend to enhance
value. The distinction between commonwealth and county
taxes was preserved, but not in the same form as the older distinction
between territorial and county taxes.</p>

<p>County police boards were now authorized to "order a certain
[variable] rate per centum on the amount of the assessment
of the State tax," and "to levy a special tax for the erection or
repair of the court house, jail or other county buildings."<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> Under
the territorial regime, it will be recollected, the county tax could
never exceed half the territorial tax.</p>

<p>This period of ante-bellum Statehood was also marked by
a radical change in the machinery of assessment and collection.
During the territorial period assessing and collecting officers
were appointed by the County Courts or by the Territorial Governor;
during this period they were chosen directly by the people
who were directly responsible for their conduct.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> The county
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>sheriff was <i>ex-officio</i> the county collector, but the assessor was a
separate officer with distinct functions. Both were biennially
elected, and the compensation of each was fixed at 5% on the
amount of the state tax assessed and collected. This per centum
remuneration could not exceed a fixed sum; the assessor's maximum
being fixed at $500 per annum and the collector's at $3000.
The fiscal machinery thus set in motion during the period of
ante-bellum Statehood is patterned on substantially the same
model today.</p>

<p>Although this period witnessed the establishment of <i>some</i>
of the main features of the modern system of State and local
taxation in Mississippi, it cannot be designated as transitional,
in the sense Prof. Ely uses the term. There was no change from
the taxation of specific kinds of property at varying rates to
the taxation of the collective mass of property at one uniform
rate. More specific kinds of property were taxed, but there
was no disposition to bunch property under a common category
at a uniform rate. The objects taxed were as specific and the
rates as variable as ever. The period was marked by an extension
of the tax system, not by its leveling-out.</p>

<p>War demands emergency revenue, and especially was this
true of the Civil War. When Mississippi formally renounced
her allegiance to the Union in 1861, the Constitutional Convention
which passed the Ordinance of Secession supplemented
this by an "Ordinance to Raise Means for the Defence of the
State."<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> This ordinance provided for the collection from each
taxpayer of an additional Special State tax of 50% on the
regular State tax, and also a tax from every inhabitant of 3-10
per cent. upon all money owned or controlled by such inhabitant&mdash;the
moneys so collected to constitute a Military Fund.</p>

<p>In 1863 it was further enacted that a special tax of 50
per cent. on the regular State tax should be levied, to be known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
as the Military Relief Tax, the proceeds to be used for the relief
of the destitute families of Confederate soldiers.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> In 1865,
in order the better to provide for the families of the soldiers a
direct tax in kind of 2 per cent, was levied on the gross amount
of all corn, wheat and bacon, in excess of 100 bushels, 25 bushels
and 100 pounds respectively; on the tolls from all grain mills in
the State, on the gross profits of leather, whether manufactured
for sale or received on shares as commission by tanneries; and
on all woolen and cotton factories and fabrics manufactured for
sale.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>For the benefit of the County Indigent Fund, the Boards
of Police of the several counties were empowered to levy a tax
in kind of &frac12; per cent. on all corn, wheat and bacon, grown
and produced in the State.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The exigencies of war and the depreciation of the Confederate
treasury notes, in which taxes were paid, necessitated
not only the levy of special taxes, but an increase in the number
and rates of the specific objects taxed. Notable among
the additions to the regular tax schedule were taxes of five
cents a pound on all seed cotton over one bale of 500 pounds
of lint, raised by a single hand; of 2 per cent. on the gross profits
of iron foundries, machine shops, dealers and speculators<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
in grain, provisions, etc.; of 50 per cent. on the wages of mechanics
in excess of 75 per cent. profit above the actual cost of
labor and material; of twenty cents on every hundred dollars
of railroad stock which paid 3 per cent. per annum. Heretofore
the State had encouraged railroad enterprise by exemption
from taxation and before the war had even gone so far as to
levy special railroad taxes in the several counties in payment of
stock subscriptions to these enterprises. But financial expediency
dictated that premiums for industrial progress be with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>draw
and that all the State's fiscal energy be conserved for the
business of war. Emergency taxation was supplemented as a
fiscal device by depreciated cotton money, Confederate currency
and Mississippi Treasury notes, and this extreme economic tension
was only relaxed after the last troops of the Confederacy
had surrendered.</p>

<p>Upon the downfall of the Confederacy in 1865, the Constitutional
Convention assembled by Gov. Sharkey organized Mississippi
as a regular State government. The financial problem
confronting this Post-Confederate government was as hard a
Gordian knot to cut as that which confronted the Confederacy
itself. Land was worthless as an object of taxation, because it
had no value. Industries were paralyzed, and needed bonuses
rather than increased burdens. The debt contracted during
the war was not repudiated, and there was a State government
to support. How was the difficulty to be solved?</p>

<p>The Constitutional Convention of 1865 and the State legislatures
of 1865, 1866 and 1867 acted in a sensible and heroic
way in dealing with the situation. A direct tax of $1 per bale
was levied on all cotton brought to market and sold; an inheritance
tax of 1 per cent. of the gross amount of all collateral inheritances;
a tax of 3-10 per cent. upon the amount of the annual
rents and tenements. Privilege licenses were exacted
from the larger corporations best able to bear them, a notable
instance of this being the license of $2000 per annum imposed
upon express companies.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> This selection of taxable objects
proved most fortunate, the cotton tax alone yielding sufficient
revenue to support the whole state administration. The commonwealth's
indebtedness was scaled, and Mississippi was rising
Phoenix-like from the ashes of financial despondency.</p>

<p>But in 1867 there was fastened upon the State the reign
of "Reconstruction and Radicalism," which meant untold retrogression
in fiscal policy. This reign of mongrelism, ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
and depravity was formally ushered in by a motley assemblage
known as "the black and tan convention," so called
from the negroes and carpet-baggers composing it. The special
taxes levied to cover the profligacy and extravagance of this
convention, whose expenses for a period of less than five months
aggregated nearly a quarter of a million of dollars, were prophetic
of the future. Cotton, cotton gins, grist and saw mills,
ferry and wharf boats, grocery, drug and provision stores,
banks, hotels, photograph galleries, railroad and steamboat companies&mdash;all
were impaled on reconstruction's fork. Even the
freedom of the press was not respected, sums ranging from $20
to $50 being levied on each daily, tri-weekly and weekly newspaper
published in the State. The plunderers modestly concluded
their infamous schedule with the provision "that a
special tax of 50 per cent. on the State tax be levied in addition
to the State tax now assessed upon real and personal property."<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>The Constitution framed by the "black and tan convention"
was rejected and the Conservative administrations of Governors
Alcorn and Powers, both property owners and taxpayers
in the State, had the effect of tempering fiscal excesses. However,
this temperance was only temporary and, as compared
with the former period, might be called rank intoxication. In
1869 the State levy was only 1 mill on the dollar; in 1870, 5
mills; in 1871, 4 mills; in 1872, 8&frac12; mills; and in 1873, 12&frac12;
mills. This was only the State tax. In many counties a county
tax of 100 per cent. on the State tax was added, besides a Special
tax in some counties to pay the interest on their bonded debt,
and a Special tax in the incorporated towns of from 5 to 10
mills on the dollar for town purposes. In this way it happened
that the total tax paid by citizens was 2 8-10 per cent. outside
the cities, and from 3&frac12; per cent. to 4 per cent. in cities and
towns.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>With the election and inauguration of Adelbert Ames as
Governor in 1874, the spirit of plunder and revenge which
animated the aliens and negroes burst forth with a fresh fury.
The tax on land was increased to 14 mills, a rate which virtually
amounted to confiscation. Cotton was taxed $10 per bale and
the proceeds were invested in the Freedman's Savings Bank, a
gigantic swindling agency at Washington. The poll was increased
from $2 to $6 a head, and the responsibility for the payment
of the negroes poll was saddled on his white employer.
This farce fiscal comedy reached its climax in the imposition of
a 1 per cent. tax on all amounts expended by the citizens of
the State in travel.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> The people simply could not pay these
taxes, and over 6,400,000 acres of land were forfeited for nonpayment.</p>

<p>On January 4, 1875, the taxpayers driven to desperation
by this confiscation of their property met in convention and
submitted to the Legislature a most respectful appeal for relief.
The Legislature treated the petition with contempt, an action
which resulted in the organization of taxpayers' leagues over
the State and the speedy overthrow of carpet-bag government.</p>

<p>This struggle between taxpayers and tax-layers in Mississippi
is but another illustration of the truth of Edmund Burke's
saying that "from the earliest times the great battles for human
freedom have been fought out on the question of taxation."</p>

<p>But the price of the victory was dear and the penalty paid
for experience was great. In addition to a payable and interest-bearing
debt of $984,200, the carpet-baggers left outstanding,
unpaid on January 1, 1876, non-interest bearing Auditor's warrants
amounting to $414,958.31. During the last six years of
their regime, as is shown by the Auditor's and Treasurer's
books for these years, they spent $8,501,337.86, strictly on account
of the expenses of State government, an average of $1,484,699.55
per annum. They collected nearly a million dollars of what is
known as the Common School fund, and spent it all in riotous
governmental living, save the pittance of $57,000 in U. S.
bonds left in the treasury to the credit of that fund.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>
<p>This money was not spent on the common schools, the
purpose for which it was collected, but was misappropriated
and unaccounted for, and a debt against the State on account
of that fund, was left January 1, 1876, amounting to $830,378.18.
This, too, in spite of the fact that the average rates of State
and county taxation during the six years in question were 8.87&frac12;
mills and 12.49-2/3. mills respectively, making a combined average
of $21.37&frac12; on the thousand.</p>

<p>Indebtedness was thus the legacy which the "Modern
Period" [1876-1898] in Mississippi's fiscal history received
from the period of "Reconstruction and Radicalism." Although
burdened with this incubus and with increasing expenditures
for educational and eleemosynary institutions, the
"Modern Period" has been characterized by a decrease in both
State and County tax rates and by a proportionate reduction
in State indebtedness, both in amount and interest charge.</p>

<p>The first year of this period, i. e. 1876, gave earnest or fiscal
reform. State taxes were reduced from 9&frac12; mills on the dollar
to 2&frac12; mills. The taxing power of county boards of Supervisors
was restricted, a law being passed which prohibited them
from levying taxes for county purposes, which added to the
State tax, would exceed 16&frac12; mills on the dollar, except for
indispensable purposes. Supernumerary officials were dismissed,
the common school system improved, sinecures abolished
and salaries reduced. The highest rate of compensation was no
longer paid for the lowest standard of qualification. This policy
of economy in State administration has yielded substantial
results.</p>

<p>The average rate of State taxation for the past 22 years,
inclusive of 1876, has been 4.66 mills, as opposed to an average
of 8.87&frac12; mills for the six years preceding 1876. The average
rate of county taxation for the same period has been 11.1
mills, as opposed to 12.49&frac12; for the six years preceding. Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>bining
averages, we find a saving to the credit of home rule of
5.60&frac12; mills on the dollar, or 5.60&frac12; on the thousand.</p>

<p>Reduction in tax rates has meant a reversal of the policy
of confiscation. Of the 6,400,000 acres of land forfeited for
nonpayment during Reconstruction rule, all save 250,000 acres
have been redeemed. Property valuation has largely increased,
the value of real and personal property in the State today being
estimated at $156,432,328.</p>

<p>Conservative capital is seeking investment in all branches
of industrial enterprise and economic progress is following in
the wake of fiscal reform.</p>

<p>Although the total payable debt of the State has increased
from $830,750 in amount and $45,507.50 in interest charges in
1876 to $1,105,780.41 in amount and $53,421 in interest charges
in 1897, this increase is seen to be a proportionate decrease
when all the facts are considered.</p>

<p>The obligations, amounting to $876,256.57 in principal and
interest, handed down from reconstruction times have all been
paid. During the past 22 years $6,755,706.57 has been appropriated
and actually paid to common schools, as opposed to
$1,323,765.62 appropriated and $327,742.25 paid during the six
years preceding 1876.</p>

<p>During the "Modern Period" the State University at Oxford,
the Alcorn University, the Normal Schools at Holly
Springs and Tugaloo have been liberally supported. The A. &amp;
M. College has been established, built, equipped and supported
at an aggregate expense of $697,909.95. The Industrial Institute
and College has been built and supported at a cost of
$329,735.99.</p>

<p>Higher education has been liberally supported, eleemosynary
institutions established and equipped, and the Confederate
pension fund largely increased.</p>

<p>Yet these extraordinary expenditures have only meant an
addition of $282,943.91 in principal and interest to the State's
payable indebtedness. This fact alone gives character to the
administration of the State's finances, and bodes well for a wise
use of the commonwealth's taxing power in the future.</p>

<h2>TERRITORIAL GROWTH OF MISSISSIPPI<br />

J.M. WHITE, M. S.</h2>


<p>In 1783 the independence of the Thirteen Colonies in
America was recognized. Fifteen years later on April 7, 1798,
Congress passed an act a part of which was as follows: "All
that country bounded on the west by the Mississippi river; on
the north by a line to be drawn due east from the mouth of the
Yazoo river to the Chattahoochee river; on the east by the river
Chattahoochee; and on the south by the thirty-first degree of
north latitude, shall be, and hereby is constituted one district,
to be called the Mississippi Territory." More than half of
this territory is now embraced in the state of Alabama, and the
portion that remains to Mississippi constitutes something like
one-third of the area of the state. Very little of the boundary
of the original territory remains intact, and in so far as Mississippi
is concerned all that remains of this original boundary is
that around its south west corner, extending from Pearl river
along the thirty-first degree of north latitude to the Mississippi
river and up that stream to the mouth of the Yazoo river.</p>

<p>The lands that have been added to the original territory
lie to the north and to the south of it&mdash;that added on the north
comprises the South Carolina and Georgia cessions, and that on
the south a portion of the Louisiana Purchase, or Spanish cession.</p>

<p>Before going farther into this subject it is necessary that
we examine briefly some of the old grants made by Great
Britain for the purpose of stimulating the formation of Colonies
in the New World. By such an examination we hope to get a
clearer idea of the subject, and how it is that some of the
boundaries of our state are where they are. The first of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
grants to embrace the territory now in Mississippi was that
made by Charles I. to his Attorney General, Sir Robert Heath,
in 1629. This grant known as Carolina was possibly the largest
ever made to any one individual, covering as it did almost all
that part of the United States south of the present southern
boundary of Virginia and of Missouri. Mississippi was completely
swallowed up in this princely domain. Thirty years
later (1659) soon after the death of Oliver Cromwell and about
the time of the restoration of the Stuart kings to power in England,
this charter for non-user was voided, and in 1663 Charles
II. gave to eight of his royal favorites, the Lords Proprietors,
a charter to Carolina, and by a supplemental charter two years
later (June 30, 1665) granted on the petition of the Lords
Proprietors, he extended the territory of Carolina so that its
northern boundary was 36 degrees thirty minutes north latitude
and its southern 29 degrees north latitude.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> All of Mississippi
was in like manner embraced in this grant. This charter was
surrendered to the King by seven of the proprietors, act of Parliament
July 25, 1729.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It had been one hundred years since
the grant to Robert Heath. (The eighth proprietor gave up his
claim Sept. 17, 1744.) It was at this time that Carolina was
divided, South Carolina having remained a part of it until this
date. The western portion of the line separating the Carolinas,
now forms the northern boundary of Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a></p>

<p>Three years later June 9, 1732, George II., King of Great
Britain, granted a charter for the establishment of the Colony
of Georgia in America. The lands embraced by the provisions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>of this charter lay within the royal province of South
Carolina, between the Savannah and the Altamaha rivers and
the zone lying between parallels passing through the head
waters of these streams and extending to the Pacific Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Now the line passing through the head waters of the Savannah
left a zone twelve or fourteen miles wide belonging to
South Carolina, and lying between said line and the southern
boundary of North Carolina. This strip east of the Mississippi
embraced 4900 square miles and was generously ceded by South
Carolina to the United States in 1787, and today forms the northern
part of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. South Carolina's
right to this zone was not questioned nor was Georgia's right to
her western zone lying between the parallels passing through the
head waters of the Savannah and Altamaha rivers. This zone became,
as did the South Carolina zone, a part of the Mississippi
Territory, and together they constituted the lands added to the
original Mississippi territory on the north as above indicated.
But as to the original territory, viz., the zone lying between the
thirty-first and the thirty-second and one-half degrees of north
latitude, a number of disputes at different times arose. South
Carolina claimed it, Georgia claimed it, Spain claimed it, and
the United States claimed it. The contentions that arose in consequence
of these conflicting claims were protracted over a
quarter of a century.</p>

<p>In 1752 the Georgia charter was surrendered, and by virtue
of the French and Indian war which soon followed, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
treaty of Paris 1763, Great Britian made good her claim, over
France, to all lands east of the Mississippi river and began at
once to occupy this territory, which prior to 1732 had been a
"sort of free zone of doubtful ownership." The King of Great
Britain issued a proclamation, Oct. 7, 1763, creating the provinces
of East Florida and West Florida and by the same proclamation
the Georgia territory according to the charter of 1732
was extended so as to take in the lands lying between the rivers
Altamaha and St. Mary's. This proclamation also settled temporarily
a dispute which had arisen between the provinces of South
Carolina and Georgia as to the right to the said territory. The
provision is as follows: "We have also, with the advice of our
Privy Council aforesaid, annexed to our province of Georgia, all
lands lying between the rivers Altamaha and St. Mary's." Thirteen
years later the Colonies declared their independence, and, as
was natural, each claimed jurisdiction over areas previously
determined by royal charters, proclamations, &amp;c. At this time
Georgia's claims were bounded on the east by the Atlantic
Ocean and the Savannah river; on the north by a line passing
through the head waters of said river to the Mississippi; on the
west by the Mississippi river; and its southern boundary was
one with that of the United States. Her title to all of this territory
was the charter of 1732, King George III's proclamation of
Oct. 7, 1763, extending the area as provided by said charter, and
a commission<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to Governor Wright Jan. 20, 1764, which gave
him jurisdiction as far west as the Mississippi and as far south
as the thirty-first degree of north latitude.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Acting upon these claims, in 1785 the legislature of Georgia
established the County of Bourbon in the extreme southwestern
limit of her claim, and 1788 authorized the sale of large bodies
of land lying between the Tombigbee and the Mississippi rivers
to certain companies known as Virginia Yazoo, South Carolina
Yazoo, and the Tennessee Yazoo. These sales were made; but
when the State Treasurer refused to accept Georgia bills of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>credit in payment, the Virginia company withdrew the moneys
that she had previously paid and the South Carolina Company
brought suit against Georgia in the supreme court of the United
States; but the ratification of the eleventh amendment to the
Federal Constitution, privileging a state from being sued, cut
short the suit.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>In 1795 another act was passed authorizing the sale of these
lands, but on investigation it was found that many members
of the Legislature&mdash;in fact all the members voting for the sale
except one&mdash;were interested in these sales in a pecuniary way
and a third Legislature, 1796, declared the act of the previous
legislature null and void, because obtained by fraud and corruption,
and the records of all the sales and conveyances made under
it were blotted out and destroyed.</p>

<p>This, however, did not vitiate the titles of these companies
to said lands.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The supreme court of the United States decided
that the act of the Georgia legislature in repealing the prior act
for the sale of the land was unconstitutional and void, was in
violation of a contract, and that the titles of claimants were good
and valid.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of all this confusion the United States planted
the Mississippi territory with boundaries as given above,
justifying her right to do so in her belief that these lands did
not belong to Georgia or to any other state at the time of the
signing of the peace treaty in 1783, but to the United States in
common as the result of their combined effort in establishing
independence. In deference, however, to Georgia's claims, Congress
in authorizing the establishment of a government in the
Mississippi territory provided, "That the establishment of this
government shall in no respect impair the right of the state of
Georgia, or of any person or persons, either to the jurisdiction
or the soil of the said territory; but the rights and claims of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>said state, and all persons interested, are hereby declared to be
as firm and available as if this act had never been made."</p>

<p>Section I. of this act is as follows: "That the President of
the United States be, and he hereby is, authorized to appoint
three commissioners, any two of whom shall have power to adjust
and determine, with such commissioners as may be appointed
under the legislative authority of the state of Georgia, all
interfering claims of the United States and that state, to territory
situated west of the river Chattahoochee, north of the thirty-first
degree of north latitude, and south of the cession made to
the United States by South Carolina; and also to receive any
proposals for the relinquishment or cession of the whole or any
part of the other territory claimed by the state of Georgia, and
out of the ordinary jurisdiction thereof."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>To all this Georgia protested vigorously and asserted her
right to the land in question. Commissioners were, however appointed
as provided. They were not long in reaching an agreement,
which led to the cession of these lands to the United
States. The terms were about as follows: The United States gave
Georgia in exchange for these lands, a strip about twelve miles
wide now forming the northern part of Georgia; agreed to extinguish
the Indian titles within her limits; to admit the ceded
territory into the Union as a state, when the population should
number sixty thousand souls; to confirm all grants recognized
by Georgia as legal; to set apart five million acres to satisfy
claims such as those of the Yazoo companies and other companies
which Georgia did not consider legal; and to pay a million and
a quarter dollars to the state of Georgia from the proceeds of
lands sold in the said district.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> All this having been agreed to by
Congress, the cession was formally made in 1802 and two years
later, together with the South Carolina Cession lying just to its
north, became the Mississippi territory. But the contest did not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>end until Congress voted eight million dollars in 1814 in land
script to satisfy all claimants.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>The territory had not, however, reached its full growth,
for there was yet to be added the strip south of thirty-first degree
of north latitude and lying between the Perdido and the
Pearl rivers. The title to this land, and in fact all British West
Florida, was a subject of dispute between the United States and
Spain. This dispute had its origin in the indefiniteness of boundaries
as provided by the treaties given by Great Britain to said
powers on Sept. 3, 1783. The United States claimed the thirty-first
degree of north latitude as her southern boundary, while
Spain claimed as far north as thirty-two degrees and thirty
minutes north latitude as her northern boundary. The land here
in dispute, it will be observed, was that of the original Mississippi
territory. To these lands Spain waived claim by treaty,
Oct. 27, 1795.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>On April 30, 1803, France sold to the United States Louisiana.
This purchase brought in question the title of the remainder
of British West Florida, i. e., that portion lying south of the thirty-first.
This question had its origin in the indefiniteness of the
boundary of Louisiana, and although the matter was not definitely
settled until 1819, when Florida was purchased of Spain, the
United States disregarded Spain's claim, and on April 14, 1812
added that portion west of Pearl river to Louisiana, and on May
14, 1812 the remainder was incorporated with the Mississippi
territory.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>With this act the Mississippi territory reached its full
growth. It embraced all the territory which now makes up the
states of Mississippi and Alabama. It had been just fourteen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>years, one month and seven days since the original territory was
organized. It is estimated that 33,956 square miles were included
in that territory. To the north of it 54,622 square miles had been
added, and to the south 10,482 square miles, (of which 4,482
square miles is water.)<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> In all the Mississippi territory embraced
99,060 square miles. Clause four of the act organizing the territory
is as follows: "The territory hereby constituted one district,
for the purpose of government, may, at the discretion of
Congress, be hereafter divided into two districts, with separate
territorial governments in each, similar to that established by the
act. Congress exercised the right herein reserved, and on Dec.
10, 1817 the western portion of that territory embracing 46,810
square miles became the State of Mississippi, and the proud commonwealth
joined the sisterhood of States."</p>

<h2>THE EARLY SLAVE LAWS OF MISSISSIPPI.<br />

BEING SOME BRIEF OBSERVATIONS THEREON, IN A PAPER
READ BEFORE THE MISSISSIPPI HISTORICAL SOCIETY, AT A
MEETING HELD IN THE CITY OF NATCHEZ, APRIL 20-21, 1899.<br />

BY ALFRED H. STONE, ESQ.</h2>


<p>Probably no institution with which history deals has been
the centre of more momentous events, or the subject of more
earnest and acrimonious discussion than that of human slavery.
To the study of whatever of the states of civilization we may devote
ourselves, we find that, regardless of its present position of
advancement, at some period of its history the personal ownership
of human beings was a recognized feature of its social
fabric. Nor is it true that the existence of this institution at any
certain period of a people's history can be taken as an evidence
of a low state of intellectual, moral or social development during
such period. Quite the contrary was often the case,&mdash;despite the
fact that we have heard so much of "the demoralizing and
degrading effects of slavery" and are told that it was ever a
curse upon any people who tolerated it,&mdash;for both biblical and
secular history are replete with testimony to the magnificent
achievements of nations whose most glorious epochs were those
during which slavery flourished.</p>

<p>It is foreign, however, to our purpose to engage in a discussion
of slavery as a civil institution, or to question whether
its toleration was of good or evil effect, or yet to inquire whether
it could ever have justifiably existed. We propose to look at but
one of its many features,&mdash;and that merely from the standpoint
of an investigator of what has already passed into the realm of
ancient history,&mdash;become something "flat, stale and unprofitable"
to all save the curiously inclined.</p>

<p>The bitter and often unreasoning hatred, on the part of
many, of the institution and those who upheld it in this country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and the repugnance with which it came to be generally regarded
by even sincere and generously inclined people in a section in
which it was non-existent, were unquestionably largely induced
by the constant contemplation from a distance of an institution
the softer aspects of which could not be understood by strangers
to its inner life,&mdash;but of which the one dominant feature was
the bare fact of the bodily ownership of human beings,&mdash;the
mere existence of the legal right to barter, sell and trade in human-kind.
Of the relations between the master and his human
chattels, and of the laws governing those relations, except in
rare instances, they seemed to be ignorant,&mdash;as well, apparently,
as of the safeguards with which a humane public sentiment surrounded
the treatment of the slave, both by the law and the
master.</p>

<p>It is a brief consideration of some of these laws, as they
stood upon the statute books of our own state during the earlier
years of its history, that we beg to invite your attention.</p>

<p>Under an old Federal ordinance, passed in 1787, for the
government of the Northwest Territory, it was provided that in
that territory there should be "neither slavery nor involuntary
servitude," except of course for the punishment of crime. As the
Congressional act of 1798, forming the Mississippi Territory,
subjected it to the provisions of this ordinance, we note the
somewhat curious fact that in Mississippi, in its incipient territorial
organization, slavery was a prohibited institution. However,
in the act of 1802, which for the first time provided for the
establishment of a government in the Mississippi Territory, this
provision alone of that ordinance was excepted, and slavery recognized
as legal.</p>

<p>The first provision concerning slavery which we find in our
books, after Mississippi became a state, is contained in a clause
in our first constitution, adopted in the town of Washington,
August 15th, 1817, which provided that the Legislature might
establish in each county a Court of Probate, for the discharge of
various enumerated functions "and for the trial of slaves."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
This very first provision touching them seems to look to establishing
proper legal means for their control, and in itself bears
testimony to the falsity of the notion, which at that time some
pretended to entertain, that the whim of the master was the sole
law for the governing of the slave, and that the latter had no
legal status whatever.</p>

<p>A little further along in the same instrument we find the
Legislature delegated with authority to pass laws prohibitive
of the introduction into the State of slaves "as merchandise."
This apparently evidences the existence, even at that early date,
of a spirit of opposition to the business of "slave trading" as
a common vocation which easily accounts for the feeling with
which the "nigger trader" was regarded by the better classes&mdash;those
among whom he would look for purchasers of his goods.
In this same clause the Legislature is empowered to pass laws
to oblige the owner of slaves "to treat them with humanity,"
to provide for them necessary clothing and provisions, to abstain
from all injuries to them extending to "life or limb," and,
in case of the failure to comply with the directions of such laws,
the slave might be sold to some more humane master. By this
instrument it was also expressly provided that the Legislature
should never have the power to deprive the slave of the right to
an impartial trial by a jury.</p>

<p>I think it proper that we should call to mind these provisions
of our first organic law&mdash;testifying as they do to the treatment
which law and society exacted of the master toward his
slave;&mdash;but, while we can not fail to be impressed with the
spirit of justice and humanity manifested in our early constitution,
at a casual reading, some of the succeeding legislative
enactments might be regarded as extremely harsh.</p>

<p>But in considering laws of this nature, abhorrent as they
may be to our present sense of humane propriety, we must not
lose sight of the time in which they were effective, and our
judgment must be tempered by a remembrance of the fact that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
they were operative in a state of society which, while no less refined
or lower in its moral tone than our own, yet looked upon
criminal laws from a view point radically different from that of
today.</p>

<p>The debtor's prison still existed in England,&mdash;the stocks
and pillory were instruments of common use both here and
there,&mdash;the public whipping post claimed its daily victims,&mdash;the
rack and thumb-screw were still applied to refractory witnesses
in some of the courts of the old world and there was not
yet in all Christendom a country in which women had equal
property rights with men,&mdash;which, by the way, Mississippi was
the first community in the civilized world to confer, and she had
not progressed thus far by some twenty odd years.</p>

<p>For all of the many petty offenses of which the slave might
be guilty the punishment was confined to "stripes,"&mdash;few or
many in the discretion of the justice of the peace, though for
every offense the maximum number was fixed by law. Nor could
they be applied but by authority of the magistrate, after due
examination, though there was almost invariably coupled with
the designating of the number of stripes the injunction that they
be "well laid on." The mode of procedure in all cases wherein
the offense was punishable with stripes was for the justice to
summon "two respectable slave-holders to assist him,"&mdash;the evidence
for and against the accused being laid before them, the
three determined his guilt and fixed the punishment,&mdash;within
the limits of the law.</p>

<p>The extent of this punishment varied all the way from ten
stripes for "presuming to come upon the plantation of any person
without leave from his master," up to thirty-nine for grand
and petty larceny, between the punishment for which there was
no difference, and for "buying or selling without a written permission
from his master." This latter seems to have been regarded
as quite an offense, as we have frequent references to it,&mdash;the
punishment fixed being as great as that attached to misdemeanors
which we would consider much graver. It merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
consisted in the slave buying or selling anything whatever without
his master's written permission,&mdash;such permission being
necessary before he could lawfully carry on even the smallest of
commercial exchanges.</p>

<p>Even in our present state of boasted enlightenment it is
questioned by many thinkers and criminologists whether we have
been wise in anywhere substituting the jail for the whipping
post for minor offenses. At all events, as a deterrent to petty
crime among our colored brethren one sound thrashing, "well
laid on," would most likely prove more efficacious than any jail
sentence imposed by a latter day justice of the peace.</p>

<p>It was unlawful for a slave to leave his master's premises
without permission, and an offense for a negro, bond or free, to
have in his possession any weapons of any kind. The penalty
for engaging in any "riots, routs or unlawful assemblages" was
the maximum thirty-nine lashes, and the same act provided that
if any white person should be convicted in the Circuit Court of
"being in company with slaves or free negroes at any unlawful
meeting" he should be fined twenty dollars, to go to the informer,
and, moreover, receive not exceeding twenty lashes on
his bare back, at the discretion of the court.</p>

<p>It was in defining such unlawful meetings or assemblages
to include "all assemblies of slaves, or free negroes or mulattoes,
mixing and associating with such slaves, above the number of
five, at any place of public resort, or at a meeting house, in the
night, or at any school, for teaching them reading or writing,
either in the day or night, under whatsoever pretext" that our
slave holding law makers sinned so grievously in the eyes of the
abolitionist. While it may be observed that this particular act
contained nothing to legally prevent a master from teaching his
slave to read and write, yet the policy of the law at that time is
of course well known to us all to have been opposed to any such
education.</p>

<p>I shall not engage in any discussion of the question of negro
education nor seek to air my personal views in regard to it, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
merely venture the statement that the experience of a third of
a century, involving the expenditure of millions of dollars by
the white race upon it,&mdash;the moral, social and intellectual condition
of the negro today calmly and fairly considered,&mdash;have not
demonstrated the unwisdom of the slave holders position of
seventy-six years ago, nor yet proven an adherence to opposite
views to be for the best interests of either race.</p>

<p>In this connection it was provided that nothing contained
in any of these enactments should be so construed as to prevent
a master from allowing his slave to go to places of religious
worship, sagely demanding, however, "that such worship be conducted
by a regularly ordained or licensed white minister, or
attended by at least two discreet and reputable white persons,
appointed by some regular church or religious society,"&mdash;it not
being lawful for a negro to exercise any of the functions of a
minister of the Gospel,&mdash;though a master might allow his slave
to preach to his own slaves, but to none others.</p>

<p>It was unlawful for a white man to do any trading whatsoever
with a slave on the Sabbath, without the consent of the
master in writing first being had by the slave, and with a free
negro it was unlawful on that day under any circumstances,&mdash;our
early fathers seemingly being at all times possessed of a
very high regard for the general efficacy and saving grace of a
written permission from the master.</p>

<p>The right of a slave to act in defense of himself when assaulted
by a white person was at all times recognized by the law,
and while it was an offense punishable by thirty-nine lashes for
a slave to "use abusive or provoking language to, or to lift his
hand in opposition to a white person" yet no punishment was
to be inflicted where it appeared to the justice that he was acting
in self defense.</p>

<p>It was not lawful for a slave to possess horses, mules, sheep,
cattle, hogs or dogs, nor could he cultivate any cotton for his
own use,&mdash;the only penalty attached, however, being the for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>feiture
of the property,&mdash;except as to dogs, for the keeping of
which he might be punished with not exceeding twenty-five
stripes. Cruel or unusual punishment, for various plantation
or household offenses, could not be inflicted on a slave by his
master,&mdash;under penalty of a fine of five hundred dollars for each
offense, the fine to go to the state treasury, for the benefit of the
"literary fund."</p>

<p>The various misdemeanors enumerated here constituted the
bulk of crimes of which it was thought probable the slave would
be guilty,&mdash;there being but few others contemplated in our early
criminal legislation.</p>

<p>For such others, however, much greater penalties were provided.</p>

<p>For an assault with intent to kill, by a slave upon a white
person, where express malice was clearly proven, the punishment
was death. If, however, only implied malice were shown
the slave was to receive any number of lashes,&mdash;not exceeding
one hundred on each day, for three days in succession. For all
such offenses it must be borne in mind, the law guaranteed to the
slave the right to a fair and impartial trial by a jury. The sheriff
was required to summon "twenty-four good and lawful men of
the vicinage," of whom at least twelve should be slave holders in
their own right, from which number a jury of twelve was selected
and duly sworn for the trial of the case. On such juries
neither the master of the offending slave nor any person related
to him, nor any one related to the prosecutor could sit. No previous
indictment was essential, but in all other respects the trial
was conducted just as in the case of a white person. It was obligatory
upon the part of the court, where the owner failed to
provide proper counsel for his slave, to appoint counsel to defend
him, charging the fee for such service to the master. The
regular right of a challenge of jurors for cause was given the
slave, and in capital cases six peremptory challenges were also
allowed him, as was also the usual right of appeal.</p>

<p>On a trial for a capital crime it was permissible for the jury
to convict of a crime under that degree, if the evidence justified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
such a verdict&mdash;the punishment then being "by burning in the
hand, or by stripes," according to the magnitude of the offense,&mdash;"burning
in the hand" being prescribed for nearly all felonies
not punishable with death.</p>

<p>The maiming or manslaughter of a white person, rape and
arson were all capital offenses,&mdash;as was also the "consulting, advising
or conspiring to make insurrection or rebellion;" while
for any free persons to be guilty of the latter offense with a
slave the death penalty was also provided. Whenever sentence
of death was finally passed upon a slave, he was always to be
allowed at least twenty days before its execution, except in case
of insurrection or conspiracy.</p>

<p>At a much later date than that which we are considering
an act was passed providing for the payment to the owner of a
condemned slave, out of the state treasury, of an amount equal
to one-half his assessed value, to be paid as soon as he was executed.</p>

<p>Wherever it was found necessary to examine a free negro
or slave, as a witness in any trial, no oath whatever was administered.
He was charged by the court to declare the truth in the
following words: "You are brought here as a witness, and, by
direction of the law, I am to tell you, before you give your evidence,
that you must tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth; and if it be found hereafter that you tell a lie, and
give false testimony in this matter, you must, for so doing, have
both your ears nailed to the pillory, and cut off, and receive
thirty-nine lashes on your bare back, well laid on, at the common
whipping post."</p>

<p class="center">It did not conclude "So help you God."
</p>

<p>The crime of perjury has always been regarded as peculiarly
heinous, and we find it punishable here more severely than
any other non-capital offense. The penalty was as indicated in
the charge, to "have one ear nailed to the pillory, and there to
stand for the space of one hour, and then the said ear to be cut
off, and thereafter the other ear nailed in like manner, and cut
off at the expiration of one other hour," in addition to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
thirty-nine lashes prescribed. However, notwithstanding the
mandatory language of the statute and of the charge, this punishment
would seem to have been discretionary, for the act concludes,
"or such other punishment as the court shall think
proper, not extending to life or limb." Be that as it may, it is
safe to conclude that no such punishment was ever inflicted, and
we can find nothing in any of the books tending to show that it
was ever resorted to.</p>

<p>It was only permissible for an owner to emancipate a slave
by and with the consent of the Legislature, and then only by
proving that such slave had "performed some meritorious act
for the benefit of the owner or some distinguished service for the
state."</p>

<p>The courts were always open to a negro held as a slave who
claimed to be entitled to his freedom,&mdash;though no person being
a member of any emancipation society could sit as a juror in the
trial of such causes.</p>

<p>While one of the earliest slave laws of which we have any
record was that prohibiting the importing of slaves for sale, it
was also made unlawful for a free negro to come into the state to
live; and in 1831 an act was passed requiring every free negro
between the ages of sixteen and fifty to remove from the state
forever. But this was not followed by a general exodus, for the
act contained a clause which allowed the negro to obtain from
the Probate Court permission to remain in the state, upon a showing
made of "good character and honest deportment,"&mdash;though
it was always exacted that every free negro should be duly registered
in the county of his residence.</p>

<p>In connection with these acts it would be interesting to review
the earlier decisions of our Supreme Court,&mdash;as showing
the spirit which actuated our judges when called upon to adjudicate
in matters wherein the slave was involved, and the fairness
and liberality displayed in the construction and application of
the laws concerning him. But it is impossible in this brief paper
to do more than glance at one or two. Among the very first de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>cisions
is one rendered in 1818, in which the learned judge held,
in passing on an appeal for freedom from a number of negroes,
claiming to be unlawfully detained as slaves, that the slaves in
the Northwest Territory became free men by virtue of the ordinance
of 1787, to which we have referred, and, with true justice,
declared that, as such, they could "assert their freedom in the
courts of this state and be protected therein." In the same opinion
he observed that "slavery is condemned by reason and the
laws of nature, and can only exist through municipal regulation;
therefore in a matter of doubt, as between depriving an
owner of a vested right, arising from law, and depriving a human
being of his liberty, a natural right, the court would lean
'in favorem vitae et libertatis,'" and the petitioners were declared
to be free.</p>

<p>In another very old case we find it early judicially determined
that, in this state, the unjustifiable killing of a slave was
murder.</p>

<p>This opinion, delivered in 1821, in the first years of our
statehood, so clearly enunciates the humane principles which
then actuated our courts, and to this good day continue to move
them, in all their dealings with the inferior race, that it is peculiarly
worthy of a place in the record of a society devoted to
preserving the earlier history of our state and its people, and
we may be pardoned for quoting its language at length.</p>

<p>It was by Justice Clarke, in reviewing an appeal by a white
man who had killed a slave in Adams county and been sentenced
to hang therefor. He said in part, "In some respects slaves may
be considered as chattels, but in others they are regarded as
men. The law views them as capable of committing crimes. This
can only be upon the principle that they are men and rational
beings. The Roman law has been much relied on by counsel for
the defendant. That law was confined to the Roman Empire,
giving the power of life and death over captives in war, as slaves,
but it no more extended here than did the similar power given
to parents over the lives of their children.... At a very early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
period in Virginia the power of life over slaves was given by
statute, but ... as soon as these statutes were repealed it
was at once considered by their courts that the killing of a slave
might be murder.... In this state the Legislature have considered
slaves as reasonable and accountable beings, and it would
be a stigma upon the character of the state, and a reproach to
the administration of justice if the life of a slave could be taken
with impunity,&mdash;if he could be murdered in cold blood, without
subjecting the offender to the highest penalty known to the
criminal jurisprudence of the county. Has the slave no rights
because he is deprived of his freedom? He is still a human being,
and possesses all those rights of which he is not deprived by the
positive provisions of the law,&mdash;but in vain shall we look for
any law passed by the enlightened and philanthropic legislature
of this state giving to the master power over the life of the slave.
Such a statute would be worthy the age of Wraco or Caligula,
and would be condemned by the unanimous voice of the people
of this state, where cruelty, even, to slaves, much less the taking
away of life, meets with universal reprobation.... Because
slaves can be bought and sold it does not follow that they can
be deprived of life.... The right of the master exists not
by force of the law of nature or of nations, but by virtue only of
the positive law of the state,&mdash;and, although that gives to the
master the right to command the services of the slave, requiring
the master to feed and clothe the slave from infancy till death,
yet it gives the master no right to take the life of the slave, and
if the offense be not murder it is not a crime, and subjects the
offender to no punishment.... A distinction once existed in
England between the killing of a Dane and a Saxon, but even in
Coke's time the killing of any rational being was murder....
At one period of the Roman history, a history written in the
blood of vanquished nations, slaves were regarded as captives,
whose lives had been spared in battle, and the savage conqueror
might take away the life of the captive, and therefore he might
take away the life of the slave. But the civil law of Rome extirpated
this barbarous privilege, and rendered the killing of a
slave a capital offense. When the Northern barbarians overran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Southern Europe, they had no laws but those of conquerors and
conquered, victors and captives, yet even by this savage people
no distinction was recognized between the killing in cold blood of
a slave or a freeman. And shall this court, in the nineteenth
century establish a principle too sanguinary for the code even
of the Goths and Vandals, and extend to the whole community
the right to murder slaves with impunity?</p>

<p>The motion to arrest the judgment must be overruled."</p>

<p>The defendant was sentenced to hang on July 27th, 1821.</p>

<p>I have endeavored as well as possible in the brief time allotted
me, to refer to the most important features of our early slave
laws. It has not been my purpose to attempt an exhausted research
into such legislation,&mdash;the object sought being merely to
show, as a matter of some historical interest, from an impartial
mention of the early acts concerning slavery, that the position of
the slave in Mississippi was not as it has sometimes been depicted;
that so far from being a creature with no legal status, subject
to the whims and caprices of his master,&mdash;a mere chattel,
over which even the power of life and death might be exercised
at will,&mdash;he was surrounded by all the protection which just
laws, humanely administered, could afford,&mdash;that the courts
were ever open to him and that he could, and did appeal to them,
and not in vain.</p>

<p>If any unknown or forgotten facts of historical importance
to us have been brought to light, my purpose has been accomplished.</p>

<p>We have only touched upon the legislative enactments concerning
slavery,&mdash;and for us, who know that it existed, it is
unnecessary to revert to that higher law which controlled the relations
between master and slave, and compelled such conduct
toward the latter as made of him in countless instances the devoted
friend.</p>

<p>Only an affection born of long years of treatment in the
main considerate and kind, could have furnished history with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
the spectacle of the espousal by the slave of his master's cause,
in a conflict the end of which meant so much of difference to the
two.</p>

<p>The four years of faithful devotion to which the women of
the South bear willing witness could never have been exhibited
by an enslaved people between whom and their masters the relations
had been other than those we know to have existed.</p>

<p>The society which made possible those relations was unique
in the history of civilization,&mdash;and in the annals of all the peoples
who have passed through bondage the conduct of the negro
slave stands without a parallel.</p>

IN MISSISSIPPI, 1798-1898.</a><a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a><br />

BY THOMAS McADORY OWEN.</h2>


<p>The Mississippi Territory was created by Act approved
April 7, 1798.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> This Act, limited in its provisions, authorized
the President "to establish therein a government in all respects
similar to that now exercised in the territory northwest of the
river Ohio," excepting expressly the prohibitive provision respecting
slavery.</p>


<h3>TERRITORIAL COURTS.</h3>

<p>The Ordinance of July 13, 1787, regulating the government
of the Northwest Territory, authorized the appointment by the
President of "a court to consist of three judges," "who shall
have a common law jurisdiction," their commission to continue
in force during good behavior. The governor and the judges were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>given a limited law making power. On May 7, 1798, just one
month after the act of formation, the President commissioned
the Governor and Secretary, and two judges&mdash;Daniel Tilton and
Peter Bryan Bruin. On June 28, 1798, the third, Wm. McGuire,
was commissioned as Chief Justice. Their law making
labors ended disastrously, the enactments being generally
condemned by the people as "repugnant to the established
principles of jurisprudence derived from the common law of
England." So great was the clamor against them that Congress
advanced the Territory into the second grade of government,
May 10, 1800. These obnoxious laws were in a few years repealed.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<p>The settled portions of the Eastern section of the Territory
(now Alabama) were so remote from the Mississippi settlements
proper as to make the duty of holding courts there very
burdensome, and often courts were not held at all. Superior
Courts were held in the District of Washington (now Washington
County, Ala.,) on the 4th Monday in Sept., 1802, by Seth
Lewis, Chief Justice, and on the first Monday in May, 1804, by
Judge David Ker, making two only in four years. Congress,
therefore, on March 27, 1804, passed a law providing an additional
judge for the Territory, to have jurisdiction in Washington
District, and to this position Harry Toulmin was appointed.</p>

<p>The "Great Bend of the Tennessee" having been thickly
settled, and formed into Madison County (now in North Alabama,)
Congress provided, March 2, 1810, a judge to have jurisdiction
therein, and to this position Obadiah Jones was appointed.
Both Toulmin and Jones served during existence of the territory.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>During the whole territorial period, 1798-1817 the <i>nisi prius</i>
courts, and the appellate courts were held by these judges, three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>in what is now Mississippi, and two in what is now Alabama.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>For the three groups of judges in the Mississippi section, the
following is the <i>probable</i> order of succession:</p>


<ul><li>1. McGuire, Lewis, Rodney, Martin, Campbell, Poindexter.</li>
<li>2. Tilton, Ker, Jones, Mathews, Leake.</li>
<li>3. Bruin, Fitts, Simpson, Archer.</li>
</ul>


<h3>TERRITORIAL ATTORNEYS AND MARSHALS.</h3>

<p>Until the Act of Congress, Feb. 27, 1813, providing for
territorial attorneys and marshals, all persons holding these positions
in Mississippi did so under local regulations. Following the
passage of the law, appointees were named who seem to have
held office during the remaining years of the territory.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>


<h3>FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT.</h3>

<p>The Act of April 3, 1818 marks the establishment in the
State of the Federal Judiciary proper.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> A judge, attorney and
marshal were authorized. The judge was given authority to appoint
a clerk. During its whole existence the number of judges
has never been increased.</p>

<p>Natchez was appointed as the place for the sitting of the
Court, twice annually, and so continued until March 3, 1835,
when there was a change to Jackson, where sessions have since
been held.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>From April 3, 1818, to June 18, 1838, the whole State constituted
one District. On the latter date it was divided into the
Northern, with the place of holding court fixed at Pontotoc, and
the Southern District, with Jackson as the place for holding the
sessions.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>On May 16, the place of holding courts in the Northern
District was changed from Pontotoc to Oxford, where courts are
now held.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The subsequent changes, resulting in the present arrangement
is as follows:<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>By Act June 15, 1882, the Eastern Division of the Northern
District was created, with Aberdeen as the place for holding
courts.</p>

<p>Feb. 28, 1887, the Western Division of the Southern District
was created, with Vicksburg as the place for holding courts.</p>

<p>April 4, 1888, Southern Division, Southern District, was
created, with Mississippi City as the place for holding courts.</p>

<p>July 18, 1894, Eastern Division Southern District, was
created, with Meridian as the place for holding courts.</p>

<p>On the secession of Mississippi in 1861, Judge Samuel J.
Gholson resigned. Mr. Lynch makes this observation on the court
during the civil war period:<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p>"When the Confederate Government was inaugurated
Judge Clayton was appointed to the bench of the Confederate
District Court for Mississippi, and held that position until the
close of the war. There was during this period, of course,
but little civil business before his court, and only one point of
a general interest in the laws of war was decided by him, which
was, that when the Government was powerless to protect, it had
no power to punish."</p>

of Justice, Washington, D. C. In the multiplicity of Mississippi
books, there is nothing of a special character relating to the
above title, and so far as is known this particular data has never heretofore
been published.

<p>
The principal repository for early Mississippi history, Claiborne's
<i>Mississippi</i> (1880), contains an account of the jurisprudence of the
Territory and State, Chapter XXXII, pp. 467-482. In Goodspeed's
<i>Memoirs of Miss.</i> (1891), Vol. I, p. 101, it is stated that Judge A. M.
Clayton contributed this chapter.
</p>
<p>
In James D. Lynch's <i>Bench and Bar of Mississippi</i> (1881), there
is an imperfect account of the judicial establishment, with a large number
of valuable biographical sketches, and portraits.

<h2>RUNNING MISSISSIPPI'S SOUTH LINE<br />

PETER J. HAMILTON, ESQ.</h2>


<p>Within a month after the 1899 meeting of this association
at Natchez, the Alabama Historical Society will be celebrating
at St. Stephens on the Tombigbee River the centenary of the
withdrawal of the Spaniards below the line of 31&deg;, which once
separated the United States from the Spanish possessions east
of the Mississippi River. In connection with this and our own
meeting place a short study of the origin and delimitation of
this, Mississippi's original south boundary, will be of interest.</p>

<p>It is an interesting question why the parallel of 31&deg; was
ever selected as a boundary. It crosses rivers not far above
their mouths and seems singularly unsuitable. It makes one
State own the source and another the mouth of all streams. It
was put in the treaty of 1782, whereby Great Britian acknowledged
American independence, for policy, because it confined
the Spaniards to the coast, which they could neither use nor
defend. Historically it was so selected because Great Britian
had made it by proclamation of October 7, 1763, the north line
of West Florida, and West Florida was captured from her by
Spain in 1780. But why had it ever been made the boundary of
Florida? The only reason apparent is that Great Britain in
1763 wanted to get immediate control only of the harbors and
did not care to have her colonial governments clash with the
Indians. The territory above was by the same proclamation
made crown lands and reserved for the use of the savages. This
policy was reflected in the great Choctaw treaty at Mobile
March 26, 1765, when a tract was ceded "the boundary be
settled by a line extended from Grosse Point, in the Island of
Mount Louis, by the course of the western coast of Mobile Bay,
to the mouth of the eastern branch of the Tombigbee River, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
north by the course of said river, to the confluence of Alibamont
and Tombigbee Rivers, and afterwards along the western bank
of Alibamont River to the mouth of Chickianoce River, and
from the confluence of Chickianoce and Alibamont rivers, a
straight line to the confluence of Bance and Tombigbee rivers;
from thence, by a line along the western bank of Bance River,
till its confluence with the Tallatukpe River; from thence, by a
straight line to Tombigbee River, opposite to Atchalikpe (Hatchatigbee
Bluff) and from Atchalikpe, by a straight line to the
most northerly part of Buckatanne River, and down the course
of Buckatanne River to its confluence with the river Pascagoula,
and down by the course of the river Pascagoula, within twelve
leagues of the seacoast; and thence, by a due west line, as far
as the Choctaw nation have right to grant." The twelve leagues
from the coast bring us to about this line of 31&deg;, as closely as
could be determined without a survey. It is true that on the
Tombigbee land was ceded up to Hatchatigbee Bluff; but that
was a reaching, in the only way possible, towards the new north
boundary of West Florida as already fixed in 1764&mdash;an east
and west line drawn through the mouth of the Yazoo River.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>But while it is true that by the treaty of 1782 Great Britain
thus acknowledged the south boundary of her revolted colonies
as the line of 31&deg;, it is not less true that she did not then own
so far south. Spain, who was in possession, recognized the
boundary through the Yazoo mouth, and, in fact, Great Britain
in this treaty proposed to do the same thing if she re-acquired
West Florida. Walnut Hills and Natchez on the Mississippi,
Fort Confederation and Fort St. Stephen on the Tombigbee
were strong Spanish posts and all above 31&deg;.</p>

<p>The all-conquering Galvez was governor-general for a
year after that treaty and would certainly have maintained
the Spanish rights by force of arms if necessary. But his successor,
the politic Miro, lived to see a rapid American growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
west of the mountains, and the death of the active King Charles
III. and the French Revolution wrought a change in Europe.
The weak Charles IV. let his wife and her notorious paramour,
Godoy, rule Spain.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> It so happened that French successes led
to peace, but Godoy thought that Spain would soon be at war
with England and that therefore peace with the United States
was important for Spanish-America. At all events he suddenly
assented to the demands of Thomas Pinckney, the American
envoy, and on October 27, 1795, signed a treaty whose second
article declared 31&deg; as the boundary from the Mississippi to
the Chattahoochee, and thence east by a line from the junction
of the Flint and Chattahoochee to the head of the St. Mary's
River.</p>

<p>The colonial authorities could never believe this agreement
<i>bona fide</i> and sought by delay to give the court a chance to
undo the treaty. In 1797 the Spanish minister declared the
United States guilty of bad faith in making friends with England
by Jay's treaty. A commissioner to run the line had to be
as much of a diplomat as of a surveyor.</p>

<p>Such, at least, was the opinion of Andrew Ellicott, whom
President Washington in the last part of 1796 sent by way of
the Ohio and Mississippi to act for the United States. Baron
de Carondelet, the governor general, was to represent Spain.
Ellicott arrived at Natchez on February 24, 1797, and until he
left on April 9, 1798,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> his time was taken up in negotiations
with commandant Gayoso de Lemos or encouraging the dissatisfied
citizens there to claim the rights of Americans.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Among
the prominent men there named by Ellicott were those on the
revolutionary committees,&mdash;Anthony Hutchins, Bernard Lintot,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Cato West, Isaac Gaillard, William Ratliff, Joseph Bernard,
Gabriel Benoist, Peter B. Bruin, Daniel Clark, Philander
Smith and Roger Dixon.</p>

<p>The permanent committee was composed of the last eight
and Frederick Kimball, who lived below the line. These were
really the government until the organization of the Territory.
Gayoso admitted the neutrality of the district even before the
Spaniards evacuated the town on March 30, 1798. Hutchins
was a disturbing factor for a time, organizing a counter committee
of safety and correspondence. Among his friends were
Thomas Green, James Stuart, Ashly, (a Baptist minister,)
Messrs. Shaw, (an attorney,) Davis, Justice King, Abner Green,
Hocket, and Mr. Hunter, afterwards member of Congress from
the Territory. Ellicott says that Gayoso declined to let Hutchins
move below the line and that he therefore remained, to be prominent
in Mississippi.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> Of the 299 pages of Ellicott's printed
Journal, the first 176 are taken up with events before beginning
the survey. General Wilkinson accuses him of officiousness with
the Spaniards and of gross immorality on board his boat on
the river. It may be true, but Wilkinson is no reliable authority,
although he ought to have been a good judge of rascality.</p>

<p>Ellicott had been in public life before. He was a Quaker
of Pennsylvania, and about 1789 ran the western line of New
York, and afterwards the lines of the District of Columbia and
the streets of Washington. In 1791 he was commissioner to
run the line between Georgia and the Creeks.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<p>On the present occasion he had with the party an escort of
soldiers, at least part of the time under the gallant Captain John
Boyer. The plans annexed as an appendix to the Journal
must largely be those of David Gillespie, who did the actual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>surveying, and his report or journal would have been of greater
value than Ellicott's. Ellicott acted as astronomer, but generally
was the outside man. He was in New Orleans, Mobile, Pensacola,
St. Marks and circumnavigating Florida, while Gillespie
was quietly plodding the forests, running a guide line and by
offsets establishing the true latitude of 31&deg;. But nothing from
Gillespie can now be found at Washington and even Ellicott's
original report seems to have shared the fate of so much else in
the vandal destruction of the capital by the enemy in 1814. For
the Spaniards Captain Minor acted as surveyor, with Patrick
Taggert as assistant, and Mr. Dunbar, (later of Mississippi
Territory,) as astronomer.</p>

<p>The American side was better provided with instruments
than the Spanish, having fourteen kinds in all.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> They consisted
of two zenith sectors (the larger one having nearly six
feet radius), "both principally executed by ____ Rittenhouse,"
a large achromatic telescope made by Dolland of London, with
terrestrial and celestial magnifying pieces, besides two small
telescopes for taking signals, a transit and equal altitude instrument
made by Ellicott and used in the New York and Washington
surveys, a regulator made by Ellicott, an instrument of
eight inches radius for taking horizontal angles, constructed by
George Adams of London, three brass sextants, one by Ramsden
being of "superior style," a surveying compass made by Benjamin
Rittenhouse "upon the newest and most approved style,"
two "excellent" stop watches, two "excellent" cases of drawing
and plotting instruments, two four-sided copper lanterns
for tracing the meridians and directions during celestial observations,
an apparatus to protect the water in using an artificial
horizon, consisting of covered cup, &amp;c., and two two-pole chains
of common construction. On the Spanish side were only an
"excellent" sextant, graduated by the vernier to 10 seconds, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
astronomical circle executed by Traughton of London, itself "a
portable observatory," "executed in a masterly manner," and
an old surveying compass of poor construction. The sextant
and circle had been the property of Dunbar, and were acquired
from him by Governor Gayoso.</p>

<p>Ellicott and party sailed from Natchez down the river and
at Clarksville began work. On April 11th, he says, they "set
up the clock, a small zenith sector, and proceeded to take the
zenith distance of pollux, for five evenings successively, the first
three, with the plane of the sector to the east and the others
with the plane west. From the result of those observations, it
appeared that we were three miles and two hundred and ninety
perches too far north. This distance my assistants, Messrs.
Gillespie, Ellicott, Jr., and Walker, traversed with a common
surveying compass and chain, to the south, in order to discover
(nearly) a proper place to encamp, and set up the large sector,
to determine the first point in the line with accuracy. When
this traverse was completed it was found to be impracticable to
convey our instruments, baggage and stores directly from
Clarksville to the most eligible place, owing to the extreme
unevenness of the country on the one hand, and the banks of
the Mississippi not being sufficiently inundated on the other,
to give us a passage by water through the swamps and small
lakes; it was therefore determined to descend the Mississippi
to the Bayou Tunica (or Willing's Bayou); from whence I
understood we could convey our instruments, stores and baggage,
either by land or water, almost to the place of beginning; though
not without some difficulty. The distance from Clarksville to
the Bayou Tunica by land is but eight and a half miles, but by
the Mississippi more than fifty.</p>

<p>"On the 24th we left Clarksville, and arrived at the Bayou
Tunica on the 26th, being detained one day by head winds.</p>

<p>"On the 27th my assistants were sent to carry a line east
from the termination of the traverse already made, into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
high land, and on the 28th I went and examined the country
over which the guide line passed, and fixed upon a very elevated
situation, about one thousand four hundred feet south of it,
for our first position; but the difficulty of getting our instruments,
baggage and stores to it, appeared much greater than I
first expected. A party of our men were directed to open a
road from the height already pitched upon, to Alston's Lake;
the distance was about one mile. The road was completed on
the 30th, and on the first day of May we moved and encamped
on the top of the hill. Our instruments, baggage, &amp;c., were
first carted from the Bayou Tunica to Alston's Lake, into which
I had previously taken through the swamp two light skiffs: the
articles were then taken by water, up the lake to the point where
our road from the hill struck it, and from thence packed on
horses to our encampment. The country was so broken, and
covered from the tops to the bottoms of the hills, with such
high, strong cane, (arundo gigantea,) and a variety of lofty
timber, that a road from the Bayou Tunica, to our camp, could
not be made by our number of hands, in less than a month
passable for pack-horses.</p>

<p>"Our observatory tent being worn out by the military, who
had no tents when they arrived at Natchez, I was now under
the necessity of erecting a wooden building for that purpose;
which I began on the 2d of May, and with the aid of four men
finished on the 4th, and set up the clock, and large zenith sector;
but the weather being unfavorable, the course of observations
was not began till the 6th, and was completed on the 16th."</p>

<p>On the 21st he was joined by Captain Minor and on the
26th by Dunbar. June 1st Gayoso, who succeeded on the death
of Carondelet, came with his suite and examined the line as
determined; but he then returned to New Orleans, leaving Minor
to represent him.</p>

<p>Ellicott in the 5th volume of the American Philosophical
Society Transactions (reprinted as an appendix to his Journal)
quotes from Dunbar the following account of the establishment
of the point on the Mississippi River:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"On the 28th of July, the line then approaching the 10th
mile, and learning that the waters of the inundation were retired
within the banks of the Mississippi, so that the lands were
become sufficiently dry to give firm footing to the labourers, the
astronomer for his Catholic Majesty taking upon himself the
extending of the line through the river low ground to the eastern
margin of the Mississippi. The party allotted for this service
did accordingly encamp at the point D, pushing the line forward.
Judging the present a convenient position for verifying
the direction of the line, the astronomer for His Catholic Majesty
established his observatory near the point D, and made
____observations with the circular instrument placed in the
direction of the tangent____.</p>

<p>"The line being extended to the margin of the Mississippi
on the 17th of August, the measurement from the point D, was
found to be 2 miles and 180 perches English measure, (or
2111.42 French toises.) At the distance of 1 and 2 miles at the
points X and Y, were erected square posts surrounded by
mounds of earth, and at a distance of 88 French feet from the
margin of the river, and in the parallel of latitude was erected
a square post 10 feet high surrounded by a mound of eight feet
in height. On this post is inscribed on the south side a crown
with the letter R underneath; on the north U. S., and the west
fronting on the river, Agosto 18th, 1798. Lat. 31&deg; N. In erecting
the mile post, due regard was paid to the quantity of the
offsets."</p>

<p>Their second camp was at Little Bayou Sara. Thence on
their progress at first was slow on account of the cane, twenty
to thirty-five feet high, matted with vines, and the many short,
steep hills, besides the rainy weather. They hardly averaged a
quarter of a mile per day. The Choctaw Indians, through whose
country they passed, never disturbed the party, however, therein
contrasting with the Creeks beyond Mobile River the next year.</p>

<p>While on Little Bayou Sara they learned of the formation
of Mississippi Territory and the appointment of Winthrop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
Sargent as governor.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> The new governor arrived in Natchez
August 6th, and General Wilkinson on the 26th, but Sargent's
health did not permit him to organize the government until
the next month.</p>

<p>But Ellicott was now outside civil complications. He made
new encampments on the line at Big Bayou Sara (whence Dunbar
returned to his home near Natchez,) Thompson's Creek,
Darling's Creek and Pearl or Half Way River. At Thompson's
the observations covered the satellites of Jupiter by night, and
the sun by day. After leaving Thompson's Creek they had
much trouble crossing swamps and rafting over deep streams.
Those named on his map are Comite, Beaver Creek, Amite, Ticfaw,
Tanchipahoe, and Boguechitoe, all easily recognized. The
soil generally was poor, covered with pines on the sandy uplands.
He naively tells us that while at Darling's a confidential
letter from the Spanish governor-general to a Spanish officer
"fell into my hands for a few hours." What right he had to
open and read official correspondence between officials of a
power with whom his country was at peace does not appear,
but espionage went so far at this period that an American commandant
at Natchez had tried to intercept Ellicott's own letters.
Evidently Ellicott thought the end justified his own means. For
he discovered that improper correspondence had been carried on
between Spanish officials and "some gentlemen in the western
part of the Union," and that nearly $20,000 had been shipped
from New Orleans in that connection. Ellicott copied the "interesting
parts" and dispatched them to the Department of
State. This may account for Wilkinson's hostility.</p>

<p>November 17-19 was occupied cutting a road through the
cane brake, building rafts and ferrying across Pearl River.
Here they had trouble getting provisions. Supplies and the
large sector had arrived by water at a bluff at the mouth of the
river, but the boat could not pass two natural rafts that blocked
up the stream, as they often did. Gillespie succeeded in cutting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
through, but provisions meantime ran out except beef. Fortunately
a small supply was secured by pack-horse from Thompson's
Creek, and after two weeks Gillespie came back from New
Orleans, bringing a few barrels of flour. After arranging for
Gillespie to correct back to Thompson's Creek, and Daniel Burnet
to carry the guide line on to the Mobile, Ellicott himself
went down the river, and thence through the Rigolets to New
Orleans, where he arrived January 4, 1799. There he obtained
supplies, conferred with Gayoso, and took observations with
his six feet sector.</p>

<p>Meantime the guide line was plodding eastwardly through
the forests. At 117 miles from the Mississippi the party passed
the Hatcha-Lucha (Black Creek) and about 168 miles they
crossed the Pascagoula (now Chickasawhay) a little above where
the Slapacha (Leaf River) falls in. This last is called Estopacha
in other documents of the time. Thence on nothing special
occurred until they reached the Mobile River, where the guide
line had diverged 517.44 perches too far north.</p>

<p>The observatory had been erected before Ellicott's arrival
from New Orleans in his schooner by way of Mobile. Observations
(solar and lunar, of Castor and Pollux, &amp;c.) were made
from March 18 to April 9, 1799. Here the large sector was used,
and the transit and equal altitude instrument also. Finally a
boundary stone was set up, marked (according to the Journal)
on the north "U. S. Lat. 31&deg; 1799," and on the south "Dominos
de S. M. C. Carolus IV. Lat 31&deg; 1799." This piece of brown
sand-stone, about three feet high is still in place near the Southern
Railway and is the basis of all surveys in south-west
Alabama.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> During this time Gillespie went up the river to St.
Stephens. With a Haddley's sextant he determined the latitude
of that place, and he also made a sketch of the river. Ellicott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
himself determined the latitude of Mobile and the point at the
mouth of the Bay.</p>

<p>Among the most serious problems of the survey was carrying
the line across the Mobile River and adjacent swamps. The
only feasible way was found to be for parties on each side to
make fire and smoke signals at certain intervals on the high lands
to the east and west.</p>

<p>While Ellicott was at Pensacola, with Colonel Hawkins,
trying to arrange with the Spanish commandant to secure the
neutrality of the Creeks, his party pushed the line forward from
the Mobile to the Escambia and Coenecuh Rivers above their
junction. The matter of the Indians was never satisfactorily
arranged, but the survey proceeded. On the Coenecuh, however,
he notes that the more pressing enemies were flies and "musquitoes,"
which made every observation a matter of great pain.
Among these was the transit of Mercury in May, 1799. Thereafter
they crossed the White Cedar Creek, Yellow Waters, and
between the 321st and 334th miles crossed and re-crossed the
larger Choctaw River, now the Choctawhatchee, and its branch,
the Pea River. Between that and the Chattahoochee were a
number of streams and lakes, but he names only the Waters of
Chapully (Chipola River.) In fact, little or no account is
given of this part of the survey, as Ellicott was not in the
party. He sailed from Pensacola and finally met the others
on the Chattahoochee.</p>

<p>There he was surrounded by hostile Indians and had difficulty
establishing in September 1799 the mound at the junction
of the Flint. He then left the party and went by sea
around Florida to the St. Mary's, while Gillespie apparently
worked overland to the sources of that river. There, as at the
beginning of the Mississippi, Ellicott built a terminal mound.</p>

<p>But at the Chattahoochee, 381 miles from the Father of
Waters, ended Mississippi Territory. And there we must bid
adieu to Ellicott and the south line alike of Mississippi and of
Alabama. Spain retired below that line in 1798-9, and before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
1820 the United States had acquired the territory south of it
even to the Gulf. As a boundary between countries the parallel
of 31&deg; has become obsolete; but the Quaker's work in running
out the old British line still remains important, for it separates
much of Mississippi from Louisiana and much of Alabama from
Florida. The stone on Mobile River is only a point of departure
in surveying; but the mounds on the Mississippi, the Chattahoochee
and St. Mary's bound civilized States instead of savage
hunting grounds, as when they were made, and one at least still
bears Ellicott's name.</p>

<h2><a name="ELIZABETH_FEMALE_ACADEMY_THE_MOTHER_OF" id="ELIZABETH_FEMALE_ACADEMY_THE_MOTHER_OF">ELIZABETH FEMALE ACADEMY&mdash;THE MOTHER OF
FEMALE COLLEGES</a><br />

BY BISHOP CHAS. B. GALLOWAY, D. D.</h2>


<p>I believe that Mississippi can justly lay claim to the honor
of having established the first chartered institution for the higher
education of young women in the South, if not in the United
States. Though called an Academy, it did full collegiate work,
had a high standard of scholarship, and conferred degrees. The
institution was located at Washington, six miles east of Natchez.
Washington had been the brilliant and busy little Territorial
Capital, and was then the center of social and political influence.</p>

<p>A recent visit to the site of that venerable school enabled
me to gather much valuable information about its work, and
heightened my appreciation of its vast educative and spiritual
influence upon the history and destiny of the Southwest. The
walls of the spacious building still stand, but the merry voices
that rang through its halls only live in the sweet echoes of a
distant past. Borrowing a style of architecture from the Spanish
of Colonial times, the structure was two and a half stories
high, the first of brick, the others in frame. A fire consumed
it twenty years ago, leaving only the solid masonry as a memorial
of the educational ambition and spiritual consecration
of Early Mississippi Methodism. Some of the grandest women
of the Southwest received their well-earned diplomas within
those now charred walls, and went out to preside over their own
model and magnificent homes. The early catalogues contain
the names of fair daughters who afterward became the accomplished
matrons of historic families. For many years the Elizabeth
Female Academy was the one institution of high grade
in the entire South for the education of young women. All
others have been followers and beneficiaries of this brave heroine
of Mississippi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>The grounds and buildings were donated to the Mississippi
Conference by Mrs. Elizabeth Roach in 1818, and in her honor
the institution was called the Elizabeth Female Academy. The
year following a charter was granted by the Legislature, of
which this is a copy:</p>

<p class="center">"<i>An Act.
To Incorporate the Elizabeth Female Academy.</i>
</p>

<p>"Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the State of Mississippi in General Assembly convened,
"That an Academy be, and is hereby established near the
town of Washington, in the county of Adams, to be known by
the name of the Elizabeth Female Academy, in honor of Mrs.
Elizabeth Roach, the founder thereof, to be under the superintendence
of John Menifee, Daniel Rawlings, Alexander Covington,
John W. Briant, and Beverly R. Grayson, and their successors
who are hereby constituted a body politic and corporate,
to be known by the name and style of 'The Trustees of the
Elizabeth Female Academy' and they and their successors are
hereby made capable of receiving real and personal estate,
either by donation or purchase, for the benefit of the institution,
<i>not exceeding one hundred thousand dollars</i>, of suing and being
sued, and of doing and performing all other acts, and shall

<p class="right">"Lieut. Governor, President of the Senate.</p>
<p>"Approved the 17th day of Feb., 1918.</p>

<p class="center">"DAVID HOLMES,</p>
<p class="right">"Governor of the State of Mississippi."</p>

<p>The "<i>announcement</i>" for the initial term appeared in the
Mississippi State Gazette, of Oct. 24th, 1818, a paper published
in Natchez, and was signed by B. R. Grayson, Secretary of the
Board of Trustees.</p>

<p>The Academy opened its doors to pupils November 12th,
1818, under the presidency of Chilion F. Stiles, and with Mrs.
Jane B. Sanderson as "Governess." Of the first President, and
the first Lady Principal of that first college for young ladies in
all the Southwest, the distinguished Dr. William Winans thus
writes most interestingly in his manuscript autobiography:</p>

<p>"Chilion F. Stiles was a man of high intellectual and moral
character, and eminent for piety. The Governess was Mrs. Jane
B. Sanderson, a Presbyterian lady of fine manners, and an excellent
teacher, but subject to great and frequent depression of
spirits. This resulted, no doubt, from the shock she had received
from the murder of her husband a few years previously
by a robber____Though a Presbyterian, and stanch to her sect,
she acted her part with so much prudence and liberality as to
give entire satisfaction to her Methodist employers and patrons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
Some of the most improving, as well as most agreeable hours, of
relaxation from my official duties were at the Academy in the
society of Brother Stiles, who combined, in an eminent degree,
sociability of disposition, good sense, extensive information on
various subjects, and fervent piety, rendering him an agreeable
and instructive companion. He was the only person I ever
knew who owed his adoption of a religious course of life <i>to the
instrumentality of Free Masonry</i>. He was awakened to a sense
of his sinfulness in the process of initiation into that fraternity.
Up to that time he had been a gay man of the world, and a
skeptic, if not an infidel in regard to the Christian religion. But
so powerful and effective was the influence upon him by somewhat
in his initiation, that from that hour he turned to God
with purpose of heart, soon entered into peace, and thenceforth
walked before God in newness of life, till his pilgrimage terminated
in a triumphant death."</p>

<p>Mr. Stiles was succeeded in the presidency by Rev. John
C. Burruss of Virginia, an elegant gentleman, a finished scholar
and an eloquent preacher. The school greatly prospered under
his administration, as it continued to do under his immediate
successor, Rev. Dr. B. M. Drake, a name that will ever live
among us as the synonym for consecrated scholarship, perfect
propriety, unaffected piety, and singular sincerity. In 1833 Dr.
Drake resigned the presidency in order to devote himself entirely
to pastoral work, and was succeeded by Rev. J. P. Thomas;
and in 1836 he gave way to Rev. Bradford Frazee of Louisville,
Ky. Rev. R. D. Smith, well known throughout the Southwest
for his rare devotion, was called to the president's chair in 1839.</p>

<p>Some of the by-laws adopted by the Board of Trustees for
the government and regulation of the Academy, recall in a measure
the rigid and elaborate rules prescribed by John Wesley
for the school at Kingswood. A few of these by-laws I here
reproduce.</p>

<p>"The President of the Academy____shall be reputed for
piety and learning, and for order and economy in the government
of his family. If married he shall not be less than thirty,
and if unmarried, not less than fifty years of age____.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Governess____shall be pious, learned, and of grave
and dignified deportment____She shall have charge of the school,
its order, discipline, and instructions, and the general deportment
and behavior of the pupils who board in or out of commons____.</p>


<h3>OF PATRONESSES.</h3>

<p>"On the last day of every academic year, the Board of
Trustees shall choose three respectable Matrons, who shall be
acting patronesses of the Academy.</p>

<p>"It shall be the duty of the patronesses to visit the school as
often as they think necessary, and inspect the sleeping rooms,
dress, and deportment of the pupils, and generally the economy
and management of the Academy, and report the same in writing
to the Board of Trustees for correction, if needed____.</p>


<h3>ON APPROPRIATION OF TIME.</h3>

<p>"All pupils boarding in commons shall convene in the large
school-room at sunrise in the morning, and at eight o'clock in
the evening for prayers.</p>

<p>"The hours of teaching shall be from nine o'clock in the
morning until noon; and from two o'clock in the afternoon until
five; but in May, June and July, they shall begin one hour sooner
in the morning and continue until noon; and from three
o'clock in the afternoon until six, Friday evenings excepted,
when the school shall be dismissed at five ____.</p>


<h3>DISCIPLINE AND DRESS.</h3>

<p>"No pupil shall be permitted to receive ceremonious visits.</p>

<p>"All boarders in commons shall wear a plain dress and uniform
bonnets.</p>

<p>"No pupil shall be permitted to wear beads, jewelry, artificial
flowers, curls, feathers, or any superfluous decoration.</p>

<p>"No pupil shall be allowed to attend balls, dancing parties,
theatrical performances, or festive entertainments ____.</p>


<p>ACADEMIC DEPARTMENTS&mdash;COURSE OF STUDY</p>

<p>"____The studies of the Senior Class are:</p>

<p>"<i>First Session.</i>&mdash;Chemistry, natural philosophy, moral philosophy,
botany; Latin, Aesop's Fables, Sacra Historia, Viri
Romae illustres.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Second Session.</i>&mdash;Intellectual philosophy, Evidences of
Christianity, Mythology, general history, Latin, C&aelig;sar's Bella
Gallica.</p>

<p>"Students who have completed the full course above, shall
be entitled to the honors of the institution, with a diploma on
parchment, for the degree of <i>Domina Scientiarum</i>____Those who
have pursued with honor the whole course of studies, shall be
entitled to remain one academic year, free of charge for tuition,
and be associated in an honorary class, to be engaged in the
pursuit of science and polite literature, and ornamental studies.
After which they shall be entitled to an honorary diploma ____."</p>

<p>The spiritual culture of the students was the supreme concern
of the faculty. The Bible was systematically taught and
revivals of religion were enjoyed. A notable one occurred in
1826.</p>

<p>The coming of Mrs. Caroline M. Thayer in the fall of 1825
was an epoch in the history of the Academy, and her administration
marked an era. She was a remarkably accomplished
woman with a genius for administration. Of her Dr. Winans,
President of the Board of Trustees thus speaks:</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Monday, Jan.</span> 16, 1826.</p>

<p>"In the evening I returned to Brother Burruss's, where I
met Sister C. M. Thayer, who has come to take charge of Elizabeth
Female Academy. She is a woman of middle size, coarse
features, some of the stiffness of Yankee manners, but of an
intelligent and pleasant expression of countenance; free in conversation
and various and abundant in information. Rev. John
C. Burruss, the President of the Academy, said: 'Mrs. Thayer
is a most extraordinary woman; I have never seen such a
teacher.'"</p>

<p>Again, under date of March 2d, 1826, in a letter to Rev.
John Lane, Dr. Winans says: "The Academy is in a very
flourishing condition&mdash;Sister Thayer is a tutoress of superior
abilities, both as teacher and governess. We are very sanguine
of the future usefulness and respectability of the Academy."</p>

<p>Mrs. Thayer was a niece of Gen. Warren, the hero of
Bunker Hill, educated in Boston, warmly recommended by Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
Wilbur Fisk, and before coming to Mississippi had made great
reputation as an author and teacher. She had taught for a
while with Rev. Valentine Cook on Green River, Kentucky, and
had published a volume of essays and poems that attracted wide
attention.</p>

<p>The editor of the <i>Southern Galaxy</i>, a paper published in
Natchez, attended the semi-annual examinations at Elizabeth
Female Academy in the Spring of 1829, and highly commended
the institution, especially "the unquestioned capacity and superior
accomplishments of the Governess," Mrs. Caroline M.
Thayer. The eloquent address delivered on the occasion by
Duncan S. Walker Esq., is published in full. In the list of young
ladies receiving special mention for scholarship is found the name
of "Miss Martha D. Richardson of Washita, La." That fair
daughter of the first college for young ladies in the South still
lives in California as the widow of the late Bishop H. H. Kavanaugh.</p>

<p>In that same issue of the paper, March 26th, 1829, is this
communication:</p>

<p class="center">"TO THE EDITOR OF THE SOUTHERN GALAXY."
</p>

<p>"Sir: The following lines are the production of a pupil in
the Elizabeth Female Academy at Washington. If you think
them worthy of a place in your paper, their insertion may aid
the cause of female literature, by awakening emulation among
your young readers, though their youthful author only intended
them for the eyes of her preceptress.</p>

<p>The annual commencement in the early summer was a great
occasion. An elaborate notice of the same, which embraced
Aug. 21st, 1829, was published in the papers of the young state&mdash;"<i>the
first detailed account</i> of such an event in Mississippi."
The essay of Miss Anna W. Boyd, who graduated with the honors
of her class, appears in full. It will be interesting to many yet
living for me to give the names of the graduates, and those distinguished

<p>In that list of young ladies will be recognized a few honored

their grandmothers who have long been among the redeemed
in heaven.</p>

<p>A Board of Visitors, consisting of such distinguished men
as Robert L. Walker, J. F. H. Caliborne and Dr. J. W. Monette,
attended that commencement, and made report as follow:</p>

<p>"____The most unqualified praise would be no more than
justice for the splendid evidence of their close attention and
assiduity, as exhibited on this occasion; and we take pleasure
in giving it as our opinion, that such honorable proof of female
literary and scientific acquirements has seldom been exhibited
in this or any other country. And while it proves the order and
discipline with which science and literature are pursued by the
pupils, it proves no less the flourishing condition and the merited
patronage the institution enjoys. Nothing reflects more honor
upon the present age than the liberality displayed in the education
of females; nor can anything evince more clearly the justness
with which female education is appreciated in the South
than this exhibition, and the interest manifested by the large
and respectable audience during the whole of the exercises. The
literary and scientific character of the Governess, Mrs. Thayer,
is too well known to admit of commendation from us ____."</p>

<h2>EARLY HISTORY OF JEFFERSON COLLEGE.<br />

BY MR. J. K. MORRISON</h2>


<p>Jefferson College was incorporated by the Legislature of
the Mississippi Territory on the thirteenth of May, 1802. The
act of incorporation was entitled: "An act to establish a College
in Mississippi Territory." The following named gentlemen attended
a meeting of the Trustees of this institution, held January
3, 1803, viz: Wm. C. C. Claiborne, John Ellis, Wm. Dunbar,
Anthony Hutchins, David Lattimore, Sulton Banks, Alexander
Montgomery, Daniel Burnet, David Kerr, D. W. Breazeale,
Abner Green, Cato West, Thos. Calvit and Felix Hughes.</p>

<p>John Ellis was appointed President <i>pro tempore</i> and Felix
Hughes, secretary.</p>

<p>The Board then proceeded to elect their officers by ballot.
His Excellency, Wm. C. C. Caliborne, was elected President,
Sir Wm. Dunbar, Vice-President, Felix Hughes, Secretary, and
Cato West, Treasurer. For some reason the last named officer
declined to serve.</p>

<p>It was next moved that the following address be submitted
to the National Government:</p>

<p>"To the Honourable Senate and House of Representatives
of the United States in Congress assembled:</p>

<p>"We, the Trustees of Jefferson College assembled, agreeable
to a law of this Territory, at our first meeting, beg leave to
address the Honourable Legislature of the United States. The
duty we owe to our Infant Institution, to the community of the
Mississippi Territory, and to the United States calls on us to lay
before you our wants and our prospects.</p>

<p>"Education in every state of the union has required, and
we believe, met in some degree the fostering hand of public
support. Every enlightened society, has been willing to contribute
in some way to the cultivation of the minds of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
rising generation, from whence so many public as well as private
benefits have been found to flow.</p>

<p>"This society has laboured under peculiar Impediments
to the pursuit of this object; lately emerged from the lethargic
influence of an arbitrary government, averse from principle to
general information our citizens have hardly as individuals yet
become sensible of the necessity, and usefulness of Education;
unaccustomed to act in concert their individual efforts have
never aimed at more than private schools.</p>

<p>"The first attempt to institute a place of general education
for the youth of this territory, has by a law of our Legislature,
devolved on us. We are sensible of the usefulness of the design
to ourselves and to our children. We are aware of the peculiar
necessity of Public Education and general information, to enable
us to maintain that Character we are called on to support,
the Character of citizens of a Republic. Our insulated situation
demands the means of education at home, and the infancy of our
community and the circumstances already mentioned demand
Patronage from our parent government.</p>

<p>"At a time when the true principles of Republicanism are
more generally than ever diffused over the United States, when
philosophy and Patriotism are so happily united in promoting
the public good, we hope we shall not ask in vain. Our citizens
may be tardy in learning the necessity of affording effectual
support by voluntary contributions; our local government has
no lands to bestow on us. But we trust the Legislature of the
United States, in whom the right of our soil is vested, will give
aid to an institution which will establish republicanism in the
minds of the youth of this territory, and be the firmest bond of
an attachment to the Union.</p>

<p>"In the Northwestern Territory, the general government
acting on the ordinance of Congress has been attentive to the
support of public instruction.</p>

<p>"Having a similar claim from a similitude of constitution,
and such pressing inducements peculiar to ourselves, we rely
with confident hope on your Honourable Body for such aid as
you may judge proper."</p>

<p>The following resolution was also adopted:</p>

<p>"That a committee of the following members, viz: Messrs.
Wm. Dunbar, Cato West, David Kerr, John Ellis, and Daniel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
Burnet be appointed to make inquiry as to the most convenient
site for Jefferson College; to receive proposals from individuals
of any donations of lands for that purpose and to report to the
Board at their next meeting."</p>

<p>On motion the following address to the citizens of the Territory
was adopted:</p>

<p>"To the People of the Mississippi Territory:</p>

<p>"The Trustees of Jefferson College assembled at their first
meeting embrace the opportunity of addressing you, our fellow-citizens
of the Mississippi Territory, we are sensible of the difficulty
of the Task to which we have been called by your representatives.
A place of public education is to be created at a
considerable expense without any public funds. The economy of
our Legislature has not as yet suffered them to lay a tax on the
community, to aid an Institution, which we hope will ultimately
conduce to our public as well as private happiness. We are called
on, therefore to supply the want of public funds by the liberality
of private patriotism.</p>

<p>"Indeed when we look forward to the consequence of a successful
attempt to raise a respectable school for the education
of the youth of this Territory, we trust the enlightened citizens
will not be wanting in furnishing the means essentially necessary.</p>

<p>"Our situation far remote from foreign schools, where a
liberal education may be procured prevents our young fellow
citizens generally from acquiring the advantages which a good
school affords. If in a few instances parents send their children
far from the inspection of their parental eye, great sacrifice must
be made of parental solicitude and great hazard of the morals
of the youth, and when these difficulties shall be overcome,
young men having finished their education return among their
fellow citizens perhaps with the power and inclination to serve
them, but too much strangers for some time to gain their confidence.
Having procured a distant education, they will enjoy
little advantages over strangers who may emigrate to this territory
from foreign countries or from some parts of the United
States. Our citizens will not enjoy the advantage of a long personal
acquaintance, to enable them to choose with judgement
those whom they ought to encourage, as teachers of youth and
preachers of religion and morality, as physicians, as lawyers, or
as law-givers.</p>

<p>"But should the liberality of the public enable the patrons
of Jefferson College to establish it as a public school for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
Territory these evils would be succeeded by important Benefits.
We should see our youth growing up under our own observation
in habits of virtue and improvement. Those who should acquire
public approbation by early talents and good behavior would be
rewarded with the merited confidence of their fellow citizens on
the entrance to public life, while strangers of merit would obtain
a just share of public favors, our citizens would not be forced
to employ persons unknown to them, to conduct their most important
interests. Our young men living together while the social
affections are yet untarnished by selfish views or party spirit
would contract such firm attachments as would conduce gradually
to obliterate that party rage which is the bane of our community
too small to make divisions tolerable.</p>

<p>"From Jefferson College as a central school would emanate
the taste and the knowledge necessary to make even a common
education more reputable and more useful. In fine, our children
being educated in the knowledge and Love of Republican Liberty
would grow up to be the firm supporters of our Republican government.</p>

<p>"We do not pretend to undertake an enumeration of all the
advantage, either public or private which the success of the
present undertaking promises; but being deeply interested as
well as yourselves in the event, we beg leave to offer you one
more observation.</p>

<p>"Bountiful Providence has given to the citizens of this territory
the means of procuring a Superabundance of wealth. It is
an awful Truth, that it will depend on the education of the
growing generation, whether a sudden increase of wealth will
be the cause of a rapid increase in knowledge and rational refinement,
or of luxury and unmeaning expense. As your growing
riches then will furnish you with the happy means of forming
the growing minds of your children to a rational love of good
learning and virtue.</p>

<p>"So the danger of leaving your property to those who
might not know how to use it usefully and innocently, shows the
necessity of devoting a part of it to their Education.</p>

<p>"Such are our views, Fellow Citizens, of the importance of
our present undertaking. We call on you then to lend your aid
to an Institution, which will be devoted to increase the common
happiness. All are interested, let all contribute something to the
public stock, let the rich give liberally and all others show their
public spirit according to their abilities, Parents will meet their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
reward in possessing the means of promoting the real happiness
of their children. Those who are not parents will enjoy the Benefit
of living, in a society increasing in civilization and those arts
and pursuits which are the ornaments of human nature."</p>

<p>A committee consisting of the following members, Messrs.
Sulton Banks, David Lattimore and Wm. Dunbar was appointed
to prepare the plan of a lottery for raising a sum not exceeding
ten thousand dollars and to make a report to the next meeting
of the Board of Trustees. This meeting was held at Selsertown.
The committee appointed for the purpose of preparing a lottery
scheme reported as follows:</p>

<p>That 2,000 tickets at $5.00 a piece be sold, $10,000.</p>

<p>No. of prizes:</p>

<p>The above prizes to be paid deducting 15% for the College.</p>

<p>A committee appointed to select a suitable location recommended
one on the lands of Mordecai Throckmorton near old
Greenville, in Jefferson county. The Board at its meeting agreed
on this site recommended, and ordered their next meeting to be
held at old Greenville, on the 11th of April following.</p>

<p>At this meeting the resolution proposing a site for the location
of the college was repealed. The next meeting was held at
Selsertown. At this meeting the Board on the 25th of July, 1803,
accepted a donation of lands offered by John and James Foster,
and Randall Gibson, adjoining the town of Washington, and
embracing Ellicott's Springs.</p>

<p>The appeal to the public for aid was unproductive; that to
Congress was responded to by a grant of a township of land and
some lots of ground in and adjoining the city of Natchez.</p>

<p>The next meeting of the Board of Trustees was held in
Natchez, on the 28th of January, 1804. Colonel Cato West, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
that time the acting governor of the Territory, reported "that
the lots in the city of Natchez, and an out-lot adjoining the same,
granted to the college by Congress, had been only located, and
that upon these lots were several valuable buildings." But a
private individual and the city of Natchez laid claim to these
buildings and an act was passed in Congress regranting them to
Natchez.</p>

<p>Appeals were made to the public but were not responded to.
A loan from the Legislature was prayed for but all the efforts on
the part of the trustees amounted to nothing.</p>

<p>The Trustees were reassembled in April, 1810, having had
no meeting since December 21, 1805.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Washington Academy had been established
and conducted by Rev. Jas. Smylie. Subscriptions were
raised and frame buildings erected on the college grounds.</p>

<p>A meeting of the two Boards was held and the building of
the Academy and the subscriptions which had been raised for
its support were transferred to the Board of Trustees of the
prospective College.</p>

<p>The Board of the Washington Academy also had lottery
tickets on sale, but found great difficulty in disposing of them.</p>

<p>Few of the tickets were sold, and fortunately for the institution
the tickets calling for the largest prizes remained unsold.
There was nothing gained from this and the next year the Board
directed suits against some of the purchasers of tickets who had
failed to pay for them.</p>

<p>The Academy buildings were placed in order and it was
published that "an academy under the superintendence of Dr.
Edwin Reese, assisted by Mr. Sam'l Graham would open on the
first of January."</p>

<p>Nine years after the chartering of Jefferson College, it started
as an academy, and as an academy it continued several years.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Trustees resumed their efforts to secure
an endowment for the proposed College. The titles to the lots in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Natchez were examined. In order to adjust the claims between
the corporation of Natchez and Jefferson College, the matter
was carried to law. In 1812 commissioners were appointed for
the recovery of such escheated property as belonged to the College,
the Legislature having granted to it all escheated property
for ten years. The authority of the Legislature was questioned
in this matter, and it was carried before Congress. The Legislature
was upheld in this and the College realized five or six thousand
dollars, but lost heavily prosecuting their claims.</p>

<p>The Secretary of the Treasury, under the authority of an
act of Congress passed the 20th of February, 1812, located on the
5th of June the township of land granted in 1803. The land
selected was situated on both sides of the Tombigbee River. But
nothing was realized from this until 1818.</p>

<p>In 1816, six thousand dollars to be paid in annual installments
was granted by the Legislature. This money was for the
purpose of hiring an instructor.</p>

<p>Mr. M'Allister, who was teaching at the time in Kentucky,
was employed, and took charge of the Institution in 1817. In
the August following the contract for the last building was let
out.</p>

<p>In 1818, the rapid immigration to Alabama caused an increase
in the value of the Tombigbee lands. An agent was sent
to Alabama, who leased the lands owned by the College for
ninety-nine years. About eight thousand dollars was received as
the first payment, and the remaining installments amounting
to more than twenty-five thousand dollars were to be paid in two,
four and six years. With such an improved state of affairs the
Board deemed it wise to borrow money to hasten the completion
of the buildings then in progress. Nine thousand dollars was obtained
from the bank and four thousand from the state.</p>

<p>The trustees were disappointed, however, in the expected
revenues from the Tombigbee lands. The government in 1820
found it necessary to adopt measures for the reduction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
enormous debts of those who had contracted for lands in more
prosperous times.</p>

<p>Liberal discounts were offered to its debtors, also the privilege
of giving up the lands they had purchased. There was a great
depreciation in the value of the lands at this time, and the purchasers
were glad to surrender them to the government.</p>

<p>The trustees offered an abatement of one-half. But all, with
one exception, gave the land to the government, as the greater
portion of it was found to be of no value. This source of revenue
to which the trustees had looked forward with such sanguine expectations
had been destroyed, heavy debts had been contracted,
and there were no means of discharging them. So the trustees and
friends of the Institution assumed the debts individually.</p>

<p>The college had a difficulty from another source. In 1818
there was an assembly of the clergy of all denominations in
Washington. Some of the clergy, believing Mr. M'Allister's
opinion to be unorthodox, publicly denounced the Institution.</p>

<p>This did the College an injury that the trustees could not
repair. Rev. R. F. N. Smith, an associate of Mr. M'Allister, was
placed at the head of the Institution, but this helped matters
very little.</p>

<p>The source of revenue having been exhausted, Mr. Smith
resigned. From 1821, an academy was kept up under various
instructors on a small scale.</p>

<p>In 1825, a measure was introduced into the Legislature to
institute suit for the recovery of the money loaned, but the
majority voted against it.</p>

<p>To afford the Legislature an opportunity of placing the institution
more immediately under its control and management
and to give to it that patronage and support to which it would be
entitled as a State Institution, the Trustees voted to give the
power of filling vacancies in their body to the Legislature. The
act was passed in January, 1826. This right was exercised for
many years.</p>

<p>In May, 1826, the Trustees were notified that the selectmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
of the city of Natchez were going to make an appeal to the
Supreme Court of the United States in the suit commenced in
1813, for the property given by Congress and claimed by the
city of Natchez. The Trustees not being able to bear the expenses
of a suit appointed a committee to compromise with the city,
which they succeeded in doing.</p>

<p>About this time the Legislature was considering the idea of
establishing a State Institution, and its executive committee at
its session in Feb. 1829, was ordered to appoint three agents to
inquire into all the means and resources in the state applicable
to the purposes of general education; to confer with the Trustees
of Jefferson College and ascertain the condition and prospects of
the Institution and whether it was practicable for the Trustees
to surrender the charter to the State, and on what terms it would
be done.</p>

<p>A meeting of the two committees was held on the 27th of
October, 1829. Questions were asked the committee from Jefferson
College concerning the college buildings; the endowment;
the number and character of its Professors; its future prospects;
the expediency of surrendering the charter; and concerning the
money loaned to the Institution by the Legislature.</p>

<p>It was found that the charter could not be surrendered to
another Institution erected in its stead.</p>

<p>This agreement was not made with the Legislature, so it
was decided to put forth greater energies than ever to build up
the Institution.</p>

<p>It was decided to adopt a system of Education similar to
that of West Point and a contract was made with E. B. Williston
and Major Halbrook.</p>

<p>They assumed all responsibilities, and hired a number of
competent instructors, and depended upon their success to pay
the salaries of each.</p>

<p>The College under this management opened on the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Monday of December, 1829. This plan was eminently successful
and for the first time since the establishment of the Institution
it was a success. A large number of students was attracted to it
and it was viewed with pride and gratification.</p>

<h2>THE RISE AND FALL OF NEGRO RULE IN MISSISSIPPI.<br />

BY DUNBAR ROWLAND, ESQ.</h2>


<p>Twenty-three years have passed into history since Adelbert
Ames, the last of the "Carpet Baggers," was driven from his high
position as governor of Mississippi by the representatives of an
outraged and indignant people. A new generation has grown
to manhood and womanhood since those stirring times that led up
to and culminated in the exposure and condemnation of the most
reckless and profligate political combination and blighting curse
that has ever burdened a free people. As we have just passed the
twenty-third anniversary of that great event it is fitting that its
memories be revived in the minds of those who took part in it,
that its lessons may be impressed upon those who are to
complete and affirm its results. The uprising of the people of
Mississippi against Negro rule was a most magnificent example
of that spirit of Southern patriotism that animated the hearts;
first of such men as Walthall, Lamar, George, Featherston,
Stone, Lowry and Harris, and then spread to the hearts of every
true man in Mississippi. The young men of the State, the rising
generation, have the greatest reverence and love for the brave
men who fought such a gallant fight for the preservation of white
supremacy in Mississippi.</p>

<p>The social, industrial and political conditions existing in
Mississippi two years after the close of the civil war can only be
properly appreciated by taking a backward view of what had
gone before. From 1817 to 1860 Mississippi was a garden for
the cultivation of all that was grand in oratory, true in science,
and enlightened and profound in law and statesmanship. Those
were years of a golden age, an age of chivalry in which she vied
with her sister States in the lists of that grand tournament that
was to decide the fate of a nation. That period of the State's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
history produced a roll too tedious to read of noble spirits, bright
wits, and elegant scholars, whose names and deeds are preserved
in the records of an admiring people. Mississippi takes special
pride in the character of Jefferson Davis, whose name will be
forever enshrined in fame's proudest niche, as the representative
of Southern honor, chivalry and manhood.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And he will live on history's page,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While cycling years shall onward move,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A victim of a senseless rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now idol of his people's love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When hate is buried in the dust,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When party strife shall break its spear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When truth is free and men are just,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then will his epitaph appear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mississippi was enriched by the power and ability of
George Poindexter, her brilliant governor and United States
senator; she points with pride to the executive ability and constructive
statesmanship of Robert J. Walker, Polk's great minister
of finance, and author of the Walker Tariff Bill; she looks
back with wondering admiration to that king of orators and
eccentric genius, S. S. Prentiss, who thrilled the American heart
with his god-like eloquence; she holds sacred the memory of
the gifted and peerless Lamar, who stood, unawed and alone, as
defender and protector, in her darkest and most trying hour; and
no stone that marks the last resting place of the great of earth
can be worthier of the Roman legend:</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Clarus et vir fortissimus.</i>"
</p>

<p>The year 1861 brought ruin and desolation upon the State.
The signal gun fired from Fort Sumter was the beginning of a
bloody fratricidal strife, and was the first act in the greatest
drama of political and social revolution known to history. That
revolution brought political, industrial and financial ruin upon
Mississippi. When peace came, it found a race of ignorant slaves,
masters of her political destiny. Then came the days of reconstruction,
and of devilish animosity and hate; days when ignor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>ance
and vice reigned supreme, and the law of brute force was
terribly triumphant. During that time a brave people were condemned
to all the suffering and oppression which crime and corruption
could invent, and tyranny inflict.</p>

<p>The political party then in power stands before the bar of
an intelligent public sentiment of today a confessed and convicted
author of the greatest and most criminal mistake of all
time. The experiment of negro suffrage was a most stupendous
blunder. Under that vicious system society was depressed
to a greater degree than could be borne. For ten long years was
Mississippi ruled by the adventurer, who filled the mind of the
negroes with a spirit of misrule, prejudice and hatred against
their former masters. He found a people impoverished by the
loss of millions in slave property, and made penniless by a long
and protracted war.</p>

<p>The State was turned over as so much prey to the hungriest
and cruelest flock of human vultures that ever cursed mankind
and the pathway towards better things was stained with the life
blood of her best and noblest. Under such a reign property was
insecure. There was open and notorious plunder without the
hope of redress. Ignorance, crime and hatred had enthralled the
white people of the state. No greater burden has ever been put
upon a suffering people, and while it lasted in Mississippi the
state was overwhelmed by a horde of ignorant, immoral and degraded
vagabonds.</p>

<p>The blighting curse of negro rule was patiently borne by
the people of Mississippi until 1875, when a halt was called, and
every white man in the State took a solemn oath before high
heaven that he would free himself and his posterity from such
a disgrace, or die in the attempt. That idea was the battle-cry
under which the campaign of 1875 was fought. That campaign
was the supreme effort of a brave people to save themselves and
their posterity from the blighting ruin of black supremacy. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was the most remarkable demonstration of courage ever shown
to an admiring world; it was the courage that dared death and
defied the world in its struggle against infamy and dishonor.
The struggle was begun by a well attended mass-meeting of leading
men from every county in the State. Lawyers left their books,
doctors their patients, preachers their sermons, merchants their
stores, and farmers their fields, and formed themselves into a
mighty force for the overthrow of misrule. These brave and determined
men met together at the State capitol in Jackson, Jan.
4th, 1875, and organized what is known to history as the Taxpayers'
Convention of Mississippi. The convention was called to
order by Hon. W. L. Nugent, one of the great lawyers of the
Jackson bar. Gen. W. S. Featherston, of Holly Springs, was
called to preside over the deliberations of the meeting, and his
pure patriotism and great influence gave force to a gathering
that was prepared to call the people of the State to arms if need
be, in defense of their rights and liberties. To Gen. Featherston
and Judge Wiley P. Harris all honor is due for the brave stand
they took at that time. They were both remarkable men of fearless
courage and sound judgement. The labors of the convention
resulted in a petition being drawn up for presentation to the
legislature setting forth the desperate condition of the State, demanding
reform and economy, and appealing to the people to
rise up in their might and overthrow their oppressors. An extraordinary
increase in taxation was shown to be almost equal
to confiscation. The convention of taxpayers claimed and showed
conclusively that in 1869 the State levy was 10 cents on the
dollar of the assessed value of lands. For the year 1871 it was
four times as great and for 1874 fourteen times as great. Such
a condition of affairs could only result in general ruin and
bankruptcy. After the adjournment of the taxpayers' convention
the delegates returned to their homes and organized local
taxpayers' leagues in every county in the State. The property-holders
determined to reduce taxation or refuse to pay their
assessments, and, if necessary, to resist the collection of all taxes
for the support of the State government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>A new legislature was to be elected in November, 1875, and
the only hope of property holders to save their lands from confiscation
was to elect a legislature composed of white men pledged
to economy. The Democratic State Convention met in Jackson
on August 3d, 1875, and was made up of the best men in every
walk of life. Gen. Charles Clark was made chairman. He was an
ex-governor of the State and was reverenced and loved for his
patriotic devotion to his adopted State. Hon. L. Q. C. Lamar was
a delegate to the convention from Lafayette county, and was the
leader in every movement. He made the greatest speech of his
life on the floor of the convention, and it served as a bugle call to
action to the white people to throw off the ruin and dishonor
that threatened them. The campaign was placed under the guidance
of Gen. J. Z. George, as chairman of the Democratic State
Executive Committee, and such men as Lamar, Walthall, Barksdale,
Lowry, Money, Featherston, Singleton and Chalmers took
the stump and aroused the people to action. The people laid aside
their business for three months and worked for the protection
of their homes and for the preservation of free institutions. The
popular heart was fired with enthusiasm as never before. Public
feeling found utterance in the following resolution that became
the slogan of the campaign, and was passed by the people of
every county in the State:</p>

<p>"<i>Resolved</i>, That without equivocation and without mutual
reservation, we intend to carry out the principles enunciated in
the platform of the Democratic party at Jackson, on the 3d day
of August, 1875, and to this we pledge our lives, our fortunes,
and our most sacred honor."</p>

<p>The State executive committee met in Jackson, August 15,
and organized for the campaign, and its first act was to issue the
ablest and most stirring address that ever came from such a
body. The address was prepared by Gen. George, the chairman
of the committee, and is a masterpiece of political literature,
and closes with this appeal: "In this contest Mississippi expects
each of her sons to do his duty; brace up old age to one more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
effort, nerve, manhood, to put forth all its strength, and invite
youth to its noblest enthusiasm."</p>

<p>In the very beginning of the campaign it became evident to
Governor Ames and the Republican boodlers that the election
would result in their defeat. Ames, in his desperation over impending
disaster, applied to the Federal government at Washington
for United States troops to be used in terrorizing the
people on election day. He boldly declared that the death of a
few thousand negroes would make sure the success of the Republican
party, and did everything in his power to bring about
an armed conflict between the two races. Bloody riots occurred
at Clinton, Yazoo City and Vicksburg, in which hundreds of
negroes were killed. President Grant refused to send Federal
troops into Mississippi, and his refusal was based on the report
of Mr. C. K. Chase, an agent of the attorney-general of the
United States, who had been sent to report on the application of
Gov. Ames for troops, his report being that there was no legal
excuse for the presence of armed men. The Democratic orators,
on every stump in the State, declared that the negro had proven
himself unworthy of the right of suffrage, and should be deprived
of it. They showed that wherever the negro controlled, depression
and ruin were evident on every side. They proclaimed aloud
that the honest, intelligent and decent white people should and
would control the State. Negro suffrage had been tried for ten
years with terrible results. They pointed to the ominous fact that
the Southern States were behind in the road for progress, just in
proportion to the number of negro voters in each. The right of
manhood suffrage was daily denounced as a doctrine that was
ruining the State by making it a prey to the worst and most depraved
elements of society. Bitter experience had taught that
freedom could not, in a moment, transform an ignorant slave
into a good citizen. The most dangerous experiment in
modern times in government had proved to be a most colossal
blunder. The negro had slavishly surrendered his vote to
the dictation of a band of petty thieves and plunderers, who
were interested in nothing but gain. Where was the State, un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>der
such control, that showed even a trace of honest, intelligent
government? The appeals to the people were effective. After the
most remarkable of political campaigns a legislature, with an
overwhelming Democratic majority, was elected. The legislature
met in Jackson, January 4, 1876, and organized by the election
of Hon. H. M. Street, of Prentiss county, speaker, and Hon.
George M. Govan, clerk. It had among its members, such men
as W. S. Featherston, W. A. Percy, H. L. Muldrow, W. F.
Tucker, W. R. Barksdale, I. T. Blount, J. S. Bailey, J. G. Hall,
G. B. Huddleston, G. D. Shands, George H. Lester and Thomas
Spight, in the house; and J. M. Stone, R. O. Reynolds, John W.
Fewell, R. H. Thompson and T. C. Catchings, in the senate.</p>

<p>At the time the legislature assembled, the executive and
judicial departments of the government were under the control
of the Radical party, made up of and dominated by negroes,
disreputable adventurers and carpet baggers. Adelbert Ames was
seated in the executive chair. At the close of the war he was in
Mississippi as a colonel in the Federal army, and after the State
government set up by the white people was overthrown by Federal
bayonets he was made military governor. After a new constitution
was adopted and Mississippi was re-admitted to the
Union, Ames was elected by the legislature to represent the
State in the United States Senate. James L. Alcorn was his colleague,
and fierce conflict arose between the two over the control
of the Republican party in the State. Alcorn was a man of
admitted ability. He had been a lifelong Whig before the war,
but became a moderate Republican after its close. When the constitution
of 1868 was adopted the military government of Ames
gave way and was succeeded by Alcorn as the first governor
elected by the people after the new organic law went into force.
Gov. Alcorn was a large property holder and really desired the
peace and prosperity of the State. His plan was to unite the old
followers of the Whig party for the control of the negro element,
and save the white people from the ruin that would result from
negro control. The new governor was soon found to be in the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of the negroes and carpet baggers, and he was sent to Washington
as a senator of the United States.</p>

<p>Ex-Gov. Robert Lowry thus writes of Alcorn and Ames as
Senators from Mississippi, in his history of the State:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Governors Alcorn and Ames were occupying their seats in
the United States Senate. The former, a man of high bearing,
wealthy, full of courage, proud and imperious, had a supreme
contempt for the pretensions of the latter, and asserted in substance,
on the floor, of the Senate, that Ames was a fraud, that his
poverty of intellect was only equalled by his arrogant assumption
of unauthorized powers; that he was not, and never had
been a citizen of Mississippi."</p></div>

<p>Ames made the best reply he could, but he was no match
in debate for his opponent. The estrangement and breach between
them culminated in both declaring themselves candidates
for governor of the State. Ames gained the negro support and
was elected, and ruled the State with all the autocratic power of
a czar. The public scandals of the Ames administration soon became
notorious throughout the State, and the legislature stood
pledged to a full investigation of all executive acts.</p>

<p>Early in the session a resolution was introduced by Gen.
Featherston providing for the appointment of a committee of
five to investigate and report whether or not Ames had been
guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors in office. The resolution
was passed and Speaker Street appointed Gen. Featherston,
Gen. Tucker, W. A. Percy, H. L. Muldrow and Fred Parsons.
After an investigation, lasting thirty-eight days, the committee
made a report recommending that Ames be impeached and removed
from office for high crimes and misdemeanors. The report
of the committee was adopted by the house, and W. S.
Featherston, W. F. Tucker, W. A. Percy, H. L. Muldrow, W. R.
Barksdale, and Thomas Spight were appointed managers to conduct
the impeachment trial before the bar of the senate. Twenty-one
articles of impeachment were presented by the committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
to the house and adopted. They contained specifications and
charges, involving high crimes and misdemeanors in office. The
senate proceeded to organize as a high court of impeachment,
and summoned Gov. Ames to appear for trial. Chief Justice
Simrall, of the Supreme court, appeared in the senate March 16,
1876, and after having the oath administered according to law
by Associate Justice Peyton, announced that the trial of Adelbert
Ames, governor of Mississippi, for high crimes and misdemeanors
in office would begin the next day. It was a time of
great excitement in Jackson, and that feeling spread all over
the State.</p>

<p>Governor Ames tried every known means in his power to
intimidate the legislature. He decided at one time to attempt
to disperse the body with Federal troops, but President Grant
would not furnish them for such a purpose. The next plan was
to collect an army of negroes in Jackson and incite them to riot
and bloodshed against the whites, but the cowardice of the
negroes prevented its accomplishment. One of the most corrupt
and colossal schemes of public robbery ever devised by a band of
plunderers was being laid bare to the eyes of an indignant people,
and every effort was made by the guilty officials to hush up
the investigation of their delinquencies. At the beginning of the
investigation the governor and his partners in crime assumed a
bold front and defied the legislature to do its worst, but when
they found that the investigation was backed by a public opinion
that knew no turning, they began to weaken and plead for
mercy. It was brought out in the investigation that the State was
full of defaulting county treasurers and sheriffs who were partisan
friends of the governor, and were allowed to retain their positions.
The investigation developed that the office of State
Treasurer was being filled by an official who had never given
bond for the faithful performance of his duty. It was found to
be the custom of the governor to remove judges from the bench
when they made decisions against his friends, and one public
official, the sheriff of a county, was removed by force of arms.
Ames was employing the same methods that he put in force dur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>ing
his right as military governor, and was applying the rules of
arbitrary martial law in times of peace. Incompetency and rascality
reigned supreme. All legislation had been in the hands of
ignorant negroes who for years, were intent upon nothing but
public pilfering. On March 29th, 1876, the court of impeachment
was opened, and the managers of the House appeared and announced
themselves ready for trial. In the meantime Ames had
become panic stricken over the certainty of conviction and offered
to resign and leave the State if the impeachment articles were
withdrawn. The one great object of the trial was to rid the State
of Ames and his gang of corrupt officials, and the managers of
the proceedings agreed to allow him to resign and the following
order was made by the impeachment court: "That articles of
impeachment heretofore preferred by the House of Representatives
against his Excellency, Adelbert Ames, be and the same are
hereby dismissed, in pursuance of the request of the House of
Representatives, this day presented by the managers in their
behalf." After that order was entered, counsel for Ames offered
the following from their client:</p>

<p class="right">"<span class="smcap">Executive Office</span>,<br />
<br />
"Jackson, Miss., March 29, 1876.<br />
</p>

<p>"To the People of the State of Mississippi:</p>

<p>"I hereby respectfully resign my office of governor of the
State of Mississippi." "<span class="smcap">Adelbert Ames.</span>"</p>

<p>After the reading of the resignation, Mr. Pryor, attorney
for the resigning governor, spoke as follows:</p>

<p>"Mr. Chief Justice and Senators&mdash;At the instance of my
learned associates, I rise merely to return to the chief justice
and the senators the expression of our grave sense of the courtesies
and kindness which we have received, both from the learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>ed
chief justice and senators, and especially from our honorable
adversaries, the managers on the part of the house."</p>

<p>By his resignation Ames practically admitted his guilt, and
soon after left the State in disgrace. Hon. John Marshall Stone
became governor of the State by virtue of his position as president
pro tem. of the senate, one day after Ames' resignation.
A better man was never made governor of any State, and with
his administration commenced an era of peace and prosperity
that continues to this day.</p>

</div></div>

<p>My "knowledge-tree" proved to be an old file of newspapers
published from 1836 to 1843.</p>

<p>As far back as 1838 an active interest was taken in Historical
Mississippi, and this Association, is not the first to try and
preserve records and deeds, facts, traditions and legends of our
beloved state.</p>

<p>A Lyceum flourished in the Natchez district, with Mr.
Dubuisson as president. A notice of a meeting that was to be
held in Washington, Miss., June 2d, 1838, says: "There is a
proposition before the Lyceum to change its name to that of
'The Mississippi Philosophical &amp; Historical Society.' It should
be incorporated, as it bids fair to be the nucleus around which
the taste and talent of this section of our state may rally."</p>

<p>Besides literature and history, an interest was taken by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
men and women of this period in many other things. Realizing
that Mississippi was an agricultural state, they formed an "Agricultural-Horticultural
&amp; Botanical Society," and one meeting
was held April 28th, 1843, in the Methodist Church in Washington,
President B. S. C. Wailes in the chair. There was no
public dinner, but every planter had enough along with him to
supply a dozen more than his own family. Col. Wailes, Mr.
Affleck and many others, we are told, kept open house; Mrs.
Shields, Miss Rawling, Miss Newman and Miss Smith were appointed
to examine and report on needle-work and other articles
of feminine industry. They made their report through Mr.
Joseph D. Shields, and awarded prizes to Mrs. Dr. Broome, Mrs.
Anna D. Winn, Mrs. Sarah West, Miss Virginia Branch, Miss
Eliza Magruder, Miss Julia Cashell, and Miss Mary McCaleb.</p>

<p>The women of the thirties had never heard of the "new
woman" yet they were fully alive to their own interest. It is
said that when the "married woman's property right" bill was
up for discussion in 1839, it was passed mainly through the
exertions and influence of Mrs. T. B. J. Hadley, who kept the
most popular boarding house in Jackson. She had become enamored
of the civil law principle in Louisiana, and was determined
to have this statute in our state. How did she accomplish
it? From the day that Adam ate the apple, women have had firm
convictions as to the best way of bringing men to their "point
of view." If any of Mrs. Hadley's boarders opposed this bill,
she put them on short rations and they had no comfort until they
gave in. By the way, it is believed that our Mississippi Statute
on this subject&mdash;property rights of married women&mdash;was the
first which was passed in any state in the Union, which was governed
by the principles of common law.</p>

<p>Politics ran high; Whigs and Democrats were ready at all
times to give reason for the faith within them, to fight for it,
yea, even to die for it at need. But through it all ran an intense
loyalty to the state. Prentiss was once on a boat coming to Natchez,
when some one remarked that the Governor of Mississippi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
was a dog. "Sir," said Mr. Prentiss, rising, "you cannot call the
Governor of Mississippi a dog in my presence; it may be that
he is a dog, but he is <i>our</i> dog."</p>

<p>In 1843, the burning question was the payment of the state
bonds issued by the Union &amp; Planters' Bank. Feeling ran high,
it was made an issue in the canvass, and the repudiators were
successful. Even to this day we are made to feel the sting of
that act, which was a blunder,&mdash;and Talleyrand tells us that "a
blunder is worse than a crime." Many were the reasons given for
the nonpayment, and in a speech delivered in 1843, at the Court
House in Natchez, Governor Tucker told his audience not to
think for a moment that the <i>real</i> great seal of the state was affixed
to those "fictitious and unconstitutional bonds." The Governor
goes on to say that when the time came to affix the great seal, no
seal was to be found, so "a Vicksburg artist was employed as a
Vulcan to forge the seal, which was to make bondsmen of the
proud and chivalrous people of Mississippi; he did his best,
probably, but as the fates would have it, his eagle turned out
to be a buzzard. We cannot but think," goes on the Governor,
"that an over-ruling destiny controlled the hiding away of the
state seal, so that its broad and honest face should never be seen
on a badge of servitude to European note-shavers&mdash;and the
Union Bank bonds no more have the seal of the state upon them,
than the figure of the bond seal looks like an eagle."</p>

<p>On May 28th, 1838, a number of literary and scientific gentlemen,
belonging to Natchez and vicinity, went to Selsertown
for the purpose of making an excavation in the large Indian
Mound, which was evidently a fortress and strong-hold of power
in the olden times. The mound is an immense mural pile, with a
watch-tower elevated many feet above the level surface of the
mound at one side. It had a subterranean or covered way leading
to its centre,&mdash;the traces of which still remained in 1838. The
large mound is most admirably situated for defense, being based
on a summit, from which there is a gentle declivity for many
hundreds of yards in every direction, commanding a sweeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
view of the horizon. It was said by the oldest inhabitants that
when they first settled near the Selsertown mounds, there were
traces of great roads more worn by apparent travel than any
roads in existence in this part of the State now (1838), leading
in different directions from the principal mound. This must
have been a great central point of aboriginal power, the great
metropolitan and kingly residence of the sun&mdash;descended dynasty
of the Natchez Kings&mdash;a dynasty embalmed in story and
song, and descended to us on the wings of legend and romance.
The gentlemen were: Rev. Messrs. Charles Tyler and Van Court,
Doctors Monette, Merwin, Benbroke, Inge, Hitchkock and Mitchell,
Judge Thatcher, Prof. Forshey, C. S. Dubisson, J. A. Van
Hosen, Thomas Farrar, Col. B. S. C. Wailes, Maj. J. T. Winn
and others.</p>

<p>One of the great orators in 1838, was Rev. J. N. Maffett.
He was much in demand for lectures and speeches, and was one
of the most extraordinary men of the age. It is said that for
imagery, enunciation, intonation and a deep knowledge of the
human heart, Mr. Maffett stood without a peer.</p>

<p>About 1843, Mr. Thomas Fletcher, of the Natchez bar, was
quite a favorite public speaker. His style was said to be smooth,
musical and polished.</p>

<p>Mississippians, in the years that are gone, were as generous
and open-hearted as they are today. They gave presents,
not valued by dollars and cents, but into which they put time,
labor and love, as the following letter proves. It was sent
with the cradle to a friend in Charleston, S. C.</p>

<p>"The body or frame of the cradle, is manufactured out of
the shell of what we call the snapping turtle, that weighed 135
pounds caught by myself out of my own waters. The railing is
constructed out of the horns of bucks, killed with my own rifle
by my own hands. The rockers were made from a walnut tree<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
that grew on my sister's plantation adjoining mine. The spring
mattress, or lining, is stuffed with wool from my own sheep.
The loose mattress is also filled with domestic wool, manufactured
and lined by my own wife. The pillows are filled with
feathers from our own wild geese, and have also been manufactured
by my own hands, after having been slain by my own
steady aim. The pavilion, which you will perceive is to be
thrown over the canopy, was fabricated, fitted and contrived by
my own right thrifty, ingenious and very industrious 'better
half.' Accompanying the cradle is a whistle which was made
by a friend residing with me, and out of a tusk of an alligator,
slain by my own hand, as well as a fan, made also by the same
friend out of the tail of a wild turkey killed by me; accompanying
the whole is the hide of a panther, dressed after the fashion
of the Chamois, the animal having been slain by my own hands,
and with my trusty rifle. This is for the stranger to loll and
roll upon when tired of his cradle."</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that these unique gifts into which the
Mississippi planter, his wife, and friend, put hours of love-labor,
are today the cherished heir-looms of some old South Carolina
family.</p>

<p>So in a minor key I have told of the past. As I read these
old files I lived over the lives of our ancestors. I could see the
crowds and hear them cheering some favorite speaker&mdash;the
audiences gathered to hear the words of eloquence from gifted
tongues&mdash;the Indians stepped for me his "sun dance," I discussed
with famous housewives the value of the articles made
by deft fingers, and sat with the planter by his fireside, forgetting
that "the tender grace of a day that is dead" will never
come back.</p>

<p>And may love for Mississippi,&mdash;her Past, Present, and
Future grow ever in our hearts.</p>

<p>"Mississippi! what bright visions, what pleasant reflections,
are associated with thy name! It is the land of flowers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of beauty, of natural wealth, of chivalry and unbending energy;
The nursery of native genius and eloquence; The home of hospitality,
the generous and confiding Patron of the unknown and
friendless stranger! Thy majestic river, thy broad prairies, thy
snow-white fields the very air we breathe&mdash;gladdens the heart,
enlarge the soul, and stimulate to noble deeds."</p>

<h2>HISTORIC ADAMS COUNTY<br />

BY GERARD BRANDON, ESQ.</h2>


<p>In the dim ages of the past, when our wondrous bluffs
emerged from the inland sea which geologists tell us once swept
over the alluvial lands of the Mississippi Valley, it would seem
that the Great Spirit with special favor smiled upon and
blessed that portion of his fair domain which is now embraced
within the present limits of "Historic Adams County," as if to
make of it an Eden for the Western World.</p>

<p>Perhaps no section of so limited an area has been more
productive of the fossil remains of pre-historic animals, or has
furnished so much to the collection of the geologist. It was
largely from Adams County that Wailes, the geologist, obtained
his collection which was afterwards purchased by the University
of Louisiana. Mammoth Bayou, just beyond the limits of the
City of Natchez, is so called on account of its so often returning
to the light, remains of this gigantic animal, and it still continues
to render its contributions. Indeed, there is scarcely a
creek or water-course in the county that has not, at some time,
contributed its share. Here also dwelt pre-historic man, the
mound-builder, who has left in Adams County many of the
monuments of himself, and notably the celebrated Emerald
Mound, near old Selsertown,&mdash;one of the largest, loftiest, and
most remarkable in the whole Valley of the Mississippi. And
so, in later days, when the first of the white race came to this
favored spot, they found here in the greatest beauty, abundance,
and perfection, all the flora and fauna of the South. Chateaubriand,
who during his exile visited the "Natchez Country,"
found here the inspiration and theme for writings which have
made him immortal, and in his "Attala," "Rene," and in his
great epic "The Natchez," has given us the impressions made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
upon his poetic imagination by the beauties of the landscape.
And while the hand of the spoiler, man, has robbed the landscape
of so many of its robes of natural beauty, there still remains
enough to touch the fancy and impress the mind. We
can still view the wondrous "Devil's Punch Bowls," in and
just beyond the northern limits of Natchez, which, while the
exact reverse of mountain scenery, presents a view almost as
wild and grand. The view from our lofty bluffs, of our mighty
river, of the green plains of Louisiana beyond, of the sun as he
sinks beneath the Western horizon, and of the moon as she
silvers the river with her parting beams, are worthy of any
painter's brush. The fertile valleys of the St. Catharine and
Second creeks still present some remains of their former beauty
and fertility, which made the Natchez Country, in its palmy
past, the promised land for so many brave and adventurous
spirits.</p>

<p>It was in this favored section that lived the celebrated
Natchez Indians, whose name is perpetuated in that of our
historic city, and who have left behind them a history of which
a Spartan would have been proud. Their civilization was
higher than that of the surrounding tribes, and their customs
and religion were similar to those of the ancient Mexicans. Like
the Mexicans, Peruvians, and ancient Persians, their god was
the sun, and in the temple built for his worship the priests kept
burning, day and night, the sacred fire. To the sun they sacrificed
the first fruits of the chase and of war, and sometimes,
(as did the Mexicans), offered human sacrifices, even of their
own children, to appease their angry deity. They honored their
chiefs with the title of "Suns," and their king was the "Great
Sun."</p>

<p>Such were the Natchez Indians, as portrayed to us by history
and tradition, in the year 1700, when first visited by Iberville,
the great French pioneer. The tribe then had about
twelve hundred warriors: but, according to their own account,
had been much more powerful; being then reduced in numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
by constant wars with surrounding tribes. So impressed was
Iberville by the beauty and natural advantages of the location,
that he decided to plant a colony here. This design was not
carried into execution however, until June, 1716, when Bienville,
the brother of Iberville, built a fort within the present
limits of Natchez, and called it "Rosalie." But peaceful relations
with the Indians were of short duration, and a few preliminary
murders on both sides were followed, in 1723, by the
first general outbreak of the Indians. This was quelled by
Bienville with characteristic cruelty and severity, which inflamed
the fires of hatred and revenge in the breasts of the
savages. Nor did the French adopt a policy which might have
averted a catastrophe that was soon to come; but persisted in
their course of treachery, aggression and oppression.</p>

<p>The Indians finally matured a plot to rid themselves of
their enemies by a general massacre. The execution of the design
was doubtless hastened by the requirement of Chopart,
commandant of Fort Rosalie, that White Apple Village, on
Second Creek about twelve miles from Natchez, should be abandoned,
so that it, with its surrounding fields, might be converted
into a French plantation. On November 28th, 1729, the Indians,
by stratagem gained admission into the fort, and the historic
massacre began.</p>

<p>The governor general, Perrier, at New Orleans, as soon as
the news was received, at once dispatched Chevalier Lubois,
with a large force from that city to exterminate the Natchez.
After a fierce but indecisive conflict, a truce was arranged, by
which the Indians surrendered the prisoners in their hands.
During the night the whole tribe crossed to the West of the
Mississippi, and entrenched themselves near the junction of the
Washita and Little rivers. Thither the vengeance of the
French still pursued them, and the destruction of this interesting
tribe is a matter of history.</p>

<p>It appears from the statements both of Monette and of
Claiborne, in their respective histories, that the forts in which
the Indians entrenched themselves, when attacked by Lubois<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
after the massacre at Fort Rosalie, were near the junction of the
St. Catherine creek with the Mississippi river. Both historians
unite in stating that after their retreat to the West of the Mississippi,
Lubois erected at Natchez near the brow of the bluffs, the
terraced Fort Rosalie,&mdash;the remains of which were plainly visible
when Monette wrote, but which, when Claiborne's history
was written, had been largely effaced by the great landslide. But
some traces still remain along the front a little distance below
the Natchez compress. The name of this second Fort Rosalie,
when occupied by the English, was changed to Panmure.</p>

<p>Both Monette and Claiborne clearly state that this second
fort was not upon the same site as the original fort of the same
name erected by Bienville, and where the massacre took place.
Monette states that the first fort was remote from the bluffs,
probably near the eastern limits of the city. Claiborne practically
confirms him, stating that the original fort was some six hundred
and seventy yards from the river. But its exact location
is not known. Local tradition, however, erroneously points out
the remains of the fort below the compress as those of the fort
where the massacre occurred. This error is doubtless the result of
confusion in the minds of persons not familiar with the historical
facts, and arising from an identity of names. Tradition was certainly
of more value years ago, when Monette and Claiborne
lived, and they must certainly have had the benefit of it.</p>

<p>With the destruction of the Natchez Indians, the French
colony located in their fertile country grew with great rapidity,
but without events of more than passing historical interest. But
the line of the Latin-French, claiming from the lakes to the gulf,
and of the Anglo-Saxon, claiming from ocean to ocean, had
crossed, and at the close of the great French and Indian Wars,
by the treaty of Paris, Feb. 16th, 1763, the banner of France
was lowered at Fort Rosalie, and instead the flag of England
floated there, with the name changed to Fort Panmure.</p>

<p>Attracted by the fertility of the country, settlers in great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
numbers now began to pour in from Georgia, the Carolinas,
and other English colonies. This remote settlement was not subject
to the influences of the great American Revolution, and
hither came many loyal to the British government, or wishing
to be neutral in the war of independence. Consequently a strong
English sentiment prevailed here during that period, as evidenced
by the attack on Col. Willing, in 1779.</p>

<p>But the English regime was of short duration. War with
Spain was begun, and in September, 1779, Galvez captured the
British post at Baton Rouge, and in its surrender Fort Panmure
was included. But so strong was the British sentiment, that the
people of the Natchez district did not quietly submit to a change
of rulers, and in 1781, there was a revolt against the Spanish
power, which, however, Galvez very promptly suppressed. By
the treaty of Paris, in 1783, Great Britain ceded to Spain all of
the Floridas south of the 31st., parallel, all north of that line
being recognized by her as within the limits of the United States,
then acknowledged by her as an independent nation. But, under
the British regime, the whole front along the Mississippi River,
as far north as the mouth of the Yazoo, had been included in
West Florida, and had passed to Spain with the surrender of
Baton Rouge, in 1781. Thus being in possession by force of arms
the Spaniards were loath to evacuate in favor of the United
States, and with characteristic pertinacity retained possession
till 1798, notwithstanding the treaty of 1783, and their recognition
of the 31st., parallel as the boundary line by the treaty of
Madrid in 1795.</p>

<p>During this period of wrongful possession, Spain dealt with
this section as if it were really a Spanish province, plainly indicating
her intention not to surrender possession except under
duress. These seventeen years form one of the most interesting
chapters in the history of Adams County. Roman Catholicism
was the state religion, and its church was the centre from which
the city of Natchez was laid out. This church was built on the
spot where the store of the Natchez Drug Company now stands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Whilst Protestants were tolerated, they were not free in the
practice of their religion. Parson Cloud, the first Episcopal minister
in this section, was persecuted and driven away, and many
interesting accounts are extant illustrative of the spirit of Spanish
bigotry and persecution. That portion of Natchez between
the church and the bluffs was reserved for residences of the
Spanish grandees,&mdash;the English, Irish, and American settlers
being assigned to other portions of the town.</p>

<p>There are still to be found here several old houses built
during the Spanish regime. They are recognizable from having
a low brick basement surmounted by a wooden upper story,&mdash;built
as if in anticipation of an earthquake,&mdash;a combination of
residence and fortification. The old Postlethwaite house on
Jefferson street is such a one. The Spanish made many grants
of land, as though Spain were the lawful sovereign, which grants
were, however, afterwards usually recognized by the American
authorities when followed by possession. The old Spanish records
in the office of the Clerk of our Chancery Court, are a treasure
store for the antiquary and historian. These records are not
quite complete, a portion having been carried away, (it is said
to Havana) by the Spaniards when they evacuated Natchez.</p>

<p>But the United States would recognize no title by adverse
possession on Spain to this fair land, and finally began to vigorously
assert her rights. About Feb. 24th, 1797, Andrew Ellicott
arrived at Natchez, accompanied by a sufficient military
escort and clothed with power as commissioner of the United
States to meet the representative of Spain, to mark out the 31st
parallel as the boundary between the two dominions. He first
camped near the present intersection of Wall and Jefferson
streets and there hoisted the American flag.</p>

<p>The Spanish governor, Gayoso, resorted to various subterfuges
and evasion to delay the fixing of the boundary line and
the evacuation of Natchez. It was not till March 29th, 1798, that
the Spaniards, after exhausting every excuse for delay, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
under the influence of a popular uprising supported by the military
forces of the United States, finally evacuated Fort Panmure.
And then they left, not by the light of day, with military
honors and with martial music and banners flying; but like
thieves, at midnight they stole silently away. It was only after
this that Governor Gayoso, from New Orleans, issued commissions
to Sir William Dunbar and Capt. Stephen Minor, as commissioners
for Spain and in May, 1798, the work of surveying
the 31st parallel was begun.</p>

<p>The State of Georgia had all along claimed as her own a
large portion of the present State of Mississippi, including what
is now the county of Adams. This territory she had organized
as the county of Bourbon in 1785, and she attempted alone to
assert her rights against Spain. There thus arose a conflict of
claims between Georgia and the United States, which was finally
adjusted and Mississippi Territory organized by Act of Congress,
approved April 7th, 1798.</p>

<p>Natchez was made the first territorial capital, and Winthrop
Sargent was appointed the first territorial governor. Sargent,
by proclamation, on April 2d, 1799, formed the Natchez District
into the two counties of Adams and Pickering,&mdash;the latter
name being afterwards changed to Jefferson.</p>

<p>Under the new regime, population and wealth increased
with amazing rapidity. Treaties were made with the Indian
tribes, and great public roads were opened up,&mdash;notably the Indian
trail known as the 'Natchez and Nashville Trace.' This was
the great government mail and overland stage route from New
Orleans to the North and East, in the early days before steamboats
plied the water or railroads traversed the land. As a natural
consequence it was infested in the vicinity of Natchez by daring
highwaymen, noted among whom were the celebrated Mason
and Murrel,&mdash;heroes of bloody deeds that would have made
Dick Turpin pale with envy.</p>

<p>Along this route, at six mile intervals, were relay stations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
for change of horses and for refreshments. The first of these was
the old town of Washington,&mdash;now a veritable deserted village.
This town was laid out and named by Ellicott, who, during the
delays incident to the evacuation of Natchez by the Spaniards
had removed his camp hither to the banks of the St. Catherine
creek. He camped by a beautiful spring that still bears his name,
and which is now within the grounds of Jefferson College. Many
years ago it was arched over, and a bath-house was supplied with
its crystal water. But even the ruins of this have all disappeared.
The old town of Washington almost rivals Natchez in its historic
associations. Here in 1803 was founded Jefferson College,&mdash;the
oldest endowed institution in the Southwest, and from whence
such men as A. Gratz Brown and Jefferson Davis were sent forth
to fight the battles of life. Here also was the celebrated Elizabeth
Academy for girls. The old building was destroyed by fire nearly
twenty years ago, but its brick walls are still standing.</p>

<p>Washington was made the territorial capital of Mississippi
by act of the legislature on Feb. 1st, 1802. Within my memory
the old brick church (founded by the celebrated Lorenzo Dow),
and which was also used as the state-house, and in which the constitutional
convention of 1817 was held, was still standing, just
within and to the right of the entrance to the campus of Jefferson
College. The ruins were sold for old brick, and thus this interesting
relic passed away. It was in this building that the preliminary
investigation of the charges against Aaron Burr was
held. He was arrested in January, 1807, near the mouth of Coles
creek, some twenty miles above Natchez, brought to Washington,
and released on bond (which he broke), with Lyman Harding
and Benijah Osmun as sureties. The room occupied by him is
still pointed out in the old Osmun residence on the "Windy
Hill" plantation, now owned by Miss E. B. Stanton. It is about
five miles from Natchez.</p>

<p>In its day, the town of Washington was a veritable literary
centre,&mdash;no doubt due to the influence of Jefferson College
and of the Mississippi Society. Monette, the historian, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Wailes, the geologist, lived, died and are buried here, and their
old homes still remain. Ingraham, the author of the "Pillar of
Fire," at one time was a professor in Jefferson College. A few
miles distant was the home of Claiborne, the historian, the rival
and compeer of Prentiss.</p>

<p>At Washington Andrew Jackson was encamped in 1813,
when he disobeyed the order to there muster out his soldiers,
and instead of doing so, marched them back to Tennessee for the
purpose. And here, a few days later, were brought some of the
British prisoners captured at the great battle of New Orleans.
Two miles from Washington was the home of General Felix
Huston. Within its limits is the grave of Judge Thomas Rodney.</p>

<p>In the early days, before the institution of slavery had assumed
its subsequent gigantic proportions, resulting in the
concentration of great landed estates in the hands of a few
wealthy slave-owners, Adams county was divided into a great
number of small farms, owned by white settlers. This is evidenced
by a study of the titles of the great plantations, the records
showing them to consist of consolidated farms, in many instances.
This is further evidenced by the great number of private
burying grounds scattered throughout the county adjacent
to Natchez and Washington, in which are found tombs with inscriptions
often a century old, and names without a living representative
here.</p>

<p>But if slavery produced decadence in one way, it produced
growth in another. Adams county, and especially the suburbs of
the city of Natchez, became the home of wealthy families, owning
broad acres, not only in this but in many other counties, and in
the neighboring State of Louisiana. The beautiful description
by Mrs. Hemans, of "The Stately Homes of England," would
have applied almost without change to the ancestral residences
occupied in ante-bellum days, by veritable lords of the manor,
surrounded by all the luxury and refinement which wealth and
slavery could produce. Some of these relics of an unforgotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
past, still remain, such as "Elmscourt," "Gloster," "Llangollin,"
"Longwood," "Auburn," "Inglewood," "Monmouth,"
"Melrose," "Arlington," "Somerset," "Oakland," "Manteigne,"
"Richmond," "Devereux," "Concord," "Sweet-Auburn,"
"Brandon-Hall," "Selma," "Green-field," "Coventry,"
"The Forest," and others. Many more have been destroyed
by the fire-fiend, and only ruins now remain. "The Forest"
the home of Sir William Dunbar, and "Selma," the original
residence of the Brandon family, were indigo plantations, in the
days before cotton was king. "Concord" is of special interest,
as an old Spanish house, and the residence of Governor Gayoso.</p>

<p>However, with the rapid increase in the population of the
other portions of Mississippi, the controlling influence at first
exercised by Adams County gradually disappeared. This was
further affected by the jealousy of our wealthy land owners
which was felt by the inhabitants of the newer and poorer interior
counties. Finally by Act of Nov. 28th, 1820, the General
Assembly gave to the present city of Jackson its name in honor
of our great Democratic warrior and statesman, and made it the
future capital of our State.</p>

<p>Thus the sceptre departed from Adams County; and while
she has ever maintained a position in the State of which her
citizens are proud, yet from this time she has ceased to be the
political centre of Mississippi, and the place where its history is
made.</p>

<p>Yet hither must Mississippians ever come, as to the cradle
in which the infant State was rocked. Hither will pilgrims journey
to visit our historic shrines and to drink from the primal
springs of a glorious past.</p>

<p>The immortal Prentiss won his first laurels here; and here
his ashes rest (side by side with those of Governor Sargent);

political antagonist. Vidal, the last governor of despotic Spain
in Louisiana, here sleeps his last sleep in the land of the free;
as does also Alvarez Fisk, the benefactor of the schools and libraries
of both Natchez and New Orleans.</p>

<p>Upon the rolls of our distinguished dead, besides those already
mentioned, are the names of Thomas B. Reed, Edward

<p>But it is not her public or professional men alone, who have
made the Historic Adams County of the past. "Her merchants
were princes," in the olden time, when ships from the ocean
were moored at the wharves of Natchez, bringing and taking in
exchange the treasures of the old world and the new. Here one
of the first cotton compresses was established. The old Mississippi
Railroad, built in 1836, but completed only as far as Hamburg,
was the earliest in the South and one of the oldest in the
Union. Its old road-bed and massive embankments still remain,&mdash;monuments
of the enterprise of our forefathers.</p>

<p>Thus, even after her political supremacy had departed,
Natchez still remained the financial and commercial centre of
this State. But the great financial panic of 1836 and 1837 came,
and like a cyclone swept our prosperity away. This was followed
by the terrible tornado of May 7th, 1840, which laid our city in
ruins, and numbered its victims by the hundred, and which is
even yet recalled with dread upon each recurrence of its anniversary.</p>

<p>I have thus endeavored to present, in epitome, an outline
of the history of Adams County, from its earliest settlement
to within times too recent to require research by the historian.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
I have endeavored likewise to indicate a few of the most interesting
spots which may be visited by the student of history coming

<h2>THE HISTORICAL OPPORTUNITY OF MISSISSIPPI<br />

BY R. W. JONES, LL. D.</h2>


<p>A writer truly and forcibly says that Americans have been
much readier to do great deeds than to record them&mdash;to make
those signal achievements that are worthy of remembrance than
to be troubled with the tediousness of writing them. If this is
true anywhere, it has in the past been unquestionably true of
Southern people and Mississippians.</p>

<p>In a recent number of the <i>American Historical Review</i>,
Albert Bushnell Hart discussed the "Historical Opportunity
of America;" and this led me to think of the Historical Opportunity
of Mississippi.</p>

<p>If anything great and systematic in the line of historical
research and production is to be done in Mississippi we must
have organization. The State Historical Society must have local
co-operation; this can be best effected by Auxiliary Historical
Societies co-operating with the Central Organization.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> The local
Society is the natural centre of historical activity. We are highly
gratified to report a decided revival of interest in history-writing
since the organization of our State Society; at least there has
been a revival as far as the production of monographs and brief
biographies.</p>

<p>The following suggestions are presented with a hope that
they will promote still further the historical work in the State:</p>

<p>1.&mdash;The educated young ladies of a locality can be interested
in the finding, classifying, and development of historical material;
the advanced pupils of High Schools and Colleges can be
induced to prepare monographs as a part of their literary work,
and all this material should be carefully calendared. We find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
as a general rule that the editors and proprietors of our newspapers
are among the most public spirited of our citizens; they
will gladly publish all local material of historical interest. In
this way duplicate printed copies of all local material can be
easily had and copies furnished for the archives and publications
of the Mississippi Historical Society.</p>

<p>2.&mdash;An important auxiliary to history is picture-making.
Experts with the Camera and amateur 'Kodakers' can facilitate
greatly the work of the historian by making and cataloguing
pictures of important objects and persons and depositing them
in the archives of the local Society and of the State Society, so
that the future historian who may not be able to visit the localities
may yet have satisfactory knowledge of them. By these
means and others we will cultivate a spirit that actively fosters
history; we will cause search to be made for old Manuscripts, for
files of old papers and every thing that will throw light on our
past history. As the author, previously referred to, states, valuable
manuscripts ought as naturally and as readily to find their
way to the archives of history as the meteorite reaches the Mineralogical
Museum.</p>

<p>3.&mdash;In the past history of Mississippi, a great many very
valuable papers have been lost and destroyed because there was
no known, safe depository for them. It need not be so any longer,
as the State Historical Society has safe depositories. If we
will all search for old historical material, write up facts and incidents
of importance that have come under our observation, or
otherwise to our knowledge, we will be doing a work creditable
to our own names and we shall make possible the writing of a
history that will represent in truthful aspect that noble race of
Southerners to which we are proud to belong, and we shall show
to the world the kindliness of those domestic institutions under
which have grown up the fairest and most attractive women who
ever graced human homes and the highest refinement and honor
that have taken up abode among men.</p>

<p>4.&mdash;I have already referred to the public spirit of the press,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
to the important service it has rendered to our cause and the
confidence with which we can continue to rely upon its co-operation.
In addition, we <i>need</i> a fund for printing the Society's
transactions and those important articles which receive the Society's
endorsement. The State Legislature would do well to
make an annual appropriation of a few hundred dollars to cover
the cost of such publications and thus encourage the interest
and pride of its citizens in that history which so intimately concerns
them and their ancestors. Other states have set us a worthy
example in this important matter. We hope the next legislature
will give this matter favorable consideration.</p>

<p>5.&mdash;The marking of historical sights and buildings with
marble or bronze, bearing appropriate inscriptions is a matter
of the liveliest importance. To some this may seem needless, but
the more we study and observe it the more we are convinced of
its educational and patriotic value.</p>

<p>One who goes to England and Scotland, and notes in their
great cities such as London and Edinburgh the numerous monuments,
mural tablets and other devices which commemorate
events and characters and deeds will understand better than
ever why the Englishman and Scotchman each is proud of his
race, his government, his country.</p>

<p>In 1896, I visited the old town of Portsmouth, Va., and as
I passed along the main street I saw a marble slab inserted flush
with the pavement, and it told that on that spot the honored and
loved Lafayette stood when he revisited the old Commonwealth
and received the grateful greetings of a people for whom
he had put his life into the perils of war.</p>

<p>The preservation of historical buildings and grounds and
the devotion of them to public and patriotic uses is of the same
character and importance.</p>

<p>The Ladies Association, aided by the eloquence of Edward
Everett, purchased Mt. Vernon and donated it to the sacred
purposes of patriotism. The preservation of the old church at
Williamsburg, Va., of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Monticello as Jefferson left it&mdash;all these and other things of like
character not only keep alive our interest in the great events of
the past but sustain and justify our civic pride.</p>

<p>Is there nothing of this kind in Mississippi that is worthy of
loving care and devotion to public use? Upon the extreme southern
border of the State, where the Magnolia blooms in its native
perfection, where the crested waves of the gulf work the sunbeams
and the moon's silvery sheen into forms of laughing beauty
that suggest the noble womanly character of the wife and the
"daughter of the Confederacy," where the roaring sea, that
cannot be hushed, tells of the unconquerable spirit of devotion
to our people and their cause, that stood erect amid all the indignities
and wrongs put upon it by a vindictive and cruel foe; here
we have Beauvoir that is worthy of the care of all Mississippians,
of all Southerners, nay of all American patriots. This property
suitably marked, will furnish one of the grandest of object lessons,
pointing to a man who bravely fought for his country on
foreign soil, who stood as an embodiment of incorruptible principle
and splendid ability on the floor of the United States
Senate and who headed a great popular movement which produced
the most philosophic, as well as the most thrilling period
of the history of this country and who shows us how a great man
can maintain his manliness and command respect and admiration
even in defeat and direst disaster.</p>

<p>Let us cultivate the spirit of history. Every intelligent citizen
of our State should take an interest in the Mississippi State
Historical Society and actively promote its objects. Let local
Societies be formed and enthusiasm in their work be engendered;
let every item of historic interest be put in typewritten or printed
form and let copies be sent to the Secretary of the Mississippi
State Historical Society and other copies lodged with the local
Society. Let us be careful to mark and preserve every object of
historic interest and to emphasize its value. Thus we shall show
that we are justly proud of our race, our State and the achievements
of our ancestors.</p>

<h2><a name="NANIH_WAIYA_THE_SACRED_MOUND_OF_THE" id="NANIH_WAIYA_THE_SACRED_MOUND_OF_THE">NANIH WAIYA, THE SACRED MOUND OF THE
CHOCTAWS.</a><br />

BY H. S. HALBERT.</h2>


<p>As Nanih Waiya is so often referred to in the folklore and
traditions of the Choctaws, the writer of this paper has deemed
it not amiss to give some account of this noted mound and, in
connection therewith, some of the legends with which it is inseparably
associated.</p>

<p>Nanih Waiya is situated on the west side of Nanih Waiya
Creek, about fifty yards from it, in the southern part of Winston
County, and about four hundred yards from the Neshoba
County line. The mound is oblong in shape, lying northwest and
southeast, and about forty feet in height. Its base covers about
an acre. Its summit, which is flat, has an area of one-fourth of
an acre. The mound stands on the southeastern edge of a circular
rampart, which is about a mile and a half in circumference. In
using the word "circular," reference is made to the original
form of the rampart, about one-half of which is utterly obliterated
by the plow, leaving only a semi-circle. This rampart is not
or rather was not, a continuous circle, so to speak, as it has along
at intervals, a number of vacant places or gaps, ranging from
twenty to fifty yards wide. According to Indian tradition, there
were originally eighteen parts or sections of the rampart, with
the same number of gaps. Ten of these sections still remain, ranging
from fifty to one hundred and fifty yards in length. All the
sections near the mound have long since been leveled by the
plow, and in other places some of the sections have been much
reduced. But on the north, where the rampart traverses a primeval
forest it is still five feet high and twenty feet broad at the
base. The process of obliteration has been very great since 1877,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
when the writer first saw Nanih Waiya. Some of the sections that
could then be clearly traced in the field on the west have now
utterly disappeared. About two hundred and fifty yards north of
Nanih Waiya is a small mound, evidently a burial mound, as
can be safely stated from the numerous fragments of human
bones that have been exhumed from it by the plow and the hoe.
The great number of stone relics, mostly broken, scattered for
hundreds of yards around Nanih Waiya, shows that it was the
site of pre-historic habitations. In addition to this, the bullets
and other relics of European manufacture evidence the continuity
of occupancy down within the historic period. The magnitude
of these ancient works&mdash;the mound and the rampart&mdash;together
with the legendary traditions connected with them, leads
one irresistibly to the conviction that this locality was the great
center of the Choctaw population during the pre-historic period.
It should here be stated that the symmetry of the mound has been
somewhat marred by a tunnel which was cut into it in the summer
of 1896 by some <i>treasure-seekers</i>, who vainly hoped to unearth
some wonderful bonanza from out the deep bosom of
Nanih Waiya.</p>

<p>The name Nanih Waiya signifies Bending Hill. <i>Warrior</i>,
the absurd spelling and pronunciation should be repudiated by
the map and the history maker. The adjective <i>Waiya</i> signifies
"bending," "leaning over," but it is difficult to see the appropriateness
of the term as applied to the mound. According to the
conjecture of the writer, the term was originally applied to the
circular rampart, which the Choctaws may have considered a
kind of <i>bending hill</i>. And in process of time the name could have
become so extended as to be applied to the mound and rampart
conjointly, and ultimately restricted to the mound alone, as is
now the case in popular usage.</p>

<p>According to the classification of the arch&aelig;ologists, Nanih
Waiya is a pyramidal mound, which kind of mounds is found
almost exclusively in the Gulf States. The chroniclers of De
Soto's expedition speak constantly of the mounds, and of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
writers, Garcilaso de la Vega tells us exactly how and why they
were made. According to his statement, in building a town, the
natives first erected a mound two or three pikes in height, the
summit of which was made large enough for twelve, fifteen or
twenty houses to lodge the cacique and his attendants. At the
foot of the mound was laid off the public square, which was proportioned
to the size of the town. Around the square the leading
men had their houses, whilst the cabins of the common people
stood around the other side of the mound. From the "lay" of
the land, the writer is satisfied that the public square at Nanih
Waiya was on the north, between the mound and the small burial
mound. In regard to the rampart, it was, no doubt, surmounted
by palisades, as De Soto's writers particularly describe the palisaded
walls, which surrounded the Indian towns. As to the gaps
in the rampart, the writer is convinced that these gaps were left
designedly as places for the erection of wooden forts or towers,
as additional protections to the town. The Knight of Elvas describes
the town of Pachaha as being "very great, walled, and
beset with towers, and many loop-holes were in the towers and
the wall." La Vega mentions the towers made at intervals of
fifty paces apart in the stockade wall of Maubila, each tower
capable of holding eight men. Dupratz describing the circular
stockade forts which he had seen among the Southern Indians,
expressly states that "at every forty paces a circular tower
juts out." Other statements from early writers could be given
showing that wooden towers were built along at intervals in the
stockade walls that surrounded the ancient towns of the Southern
Indians. These statements, no doubt, give us the correct solution
to the mystery of the gaps in the earthen rampart at
Nanih Waiya.</p>

<p>While there can be no doubt but Nanih Waiya was the
residence of the cacique and his attendants, in accordance with
the statements of La Vega, other statements induce the belief
that the summit of this mound was sometimes used as a place of
sun-worship. Sun-worship, it should here be especially noted,
was not performed as an isolated ceremony, so to speak, but came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
in as part of the programme in the transaction of all tribal business,
both civil and military. The Choctaws were sun-worshippers,
as were all the other branches of the Choctaw-Muscogee
family. They regarded the sun as the type or essence of the
Great Spirit. And as the Sun, or rather Sun-God, warms, animates
and vivifies everything, he is the Master or Father of
Life, or, to use the Choctaw expression, "<i>Aba Inki</i>," "the Father
above." In like manner, according to their belief, as everything
here below came originally from the earth, she is the
mother of creation. Sun-worship, it may here be stated, prevailed
to some extent, though in a much attenuated form, as late
as seventy years ago among the Choctaws, as is evidenced by the
actions of the Choctaws of that day during an eclipse of the sun.
Even at the present day some faint traces of this sun-worship
may be seen in the antics of a Choctaw prophet at a ball play.
The chroniclers of De Soto's expedition give us frequent hints
as to the prevalence of sun-worship among the Indian tribes
of the countries which the Spanish army traversed. Two centuries
later, William Bartram, in his description of the Creek
rotunda, which was erected upon an artificial mound, gives an
elaborate account of the ceremonies in the rotunda connected
with partaking of the black drink. He states that the chief first
puffed a few whiffs from the sacred pipe, blowing the whiffs
ceremoniously upward towards the sun, or, as it was generally
supposed, to the Great Spirit, and then puffing the smoke from
the pipe towards the four cardinal points. The pipe was then
carried to different persons and smoked by them in turn.</p>

<p>Imagination, perhaps, would not err, if going back a few
centuries, we could depict scenes similar to this as often enacted
upon the flat summit of Nanih Waiya. And, perhaps, the superstitious
reverence which the Choctaws have ever manifested towards
this mound may be a dim traditionary reminiscence of its
once having been a great tribal center of solar worship. The
aboriginal mind, in sun-worship, from viewing the sun as the
Father of Life, as without the light and warmth of the sun
nothing would spring into existence, no doubt instinctively turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>ed
to the earth as the Mother of Creation. If there was a father
there must be a mother. In the course of time, what more natural
that the pre-historic villagers living at the base of Nanih Waiya,
with its tremendous pile ever looming up before their eyes,
should finally come to regard it as the mother of their race. As
far back as history and tradition run, Nanih Waiya has ever
thus been regarded by the untutored Choctaws of Mississippi.
During the various emigrations from the State, many Choctaws
declared that they would never go west and abandon their
mother; and that just as long as Nanih Waiya stood, they intended
to stay and live in the land of their nativity.</p>

<p>There is another evidence that Nanih Waiya was a great
national center during the pre-historic period. The ravages of
civilization have still spared some traces of two broad, deeply
worn roads or highways connected with the mound, in which now
stand large oak trees. The remnant of one of these highways,
several hundred yards long, can be seen on the east side of the
creek, running toward the southeast. The other is on the west
side of the creek, the traces nearest the mound being at the northeastern
part of the rampart, thence running towards the north.
Many years ago this latter road was traced by an old citizen
of Winston county full twenty miles to the north until it was
lost in Noxubee swamp, in the northeastern part of Winston
County. These are the sole traces of the many highways, that no
doubt, in pre-historic times, centered at Nanih Waiya.</p>

<p>Nanih Waiya is a prominent feature in the migration legend
of the Choctaws, of which there are several versions. While the
versions all agree, to some extent, in their main features, as the
immigration from the west or northwest, the prophet and his
sacred pole, and the final settlement at Nanih Waiya, there is
still much diversity in the respective narratives in regard to the
details and other minutiae. The most circumstantial narrative is
that of the Rev. Alfred Wright, published in an issue of the
<i>Missionary Herald</i> of 1828. The version given in Colonel Claiborne's
"<i>Mississippi</i>," pages 483, 484, is a very unsatisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
version. The writer of this paper wrote this version in 1877, and
sent it to Colonel Claiborne, who inserted it in his history. It
was taken down from the lips of Mr. Jack Henry, an old citizen
of Okitibbeha County, he stating that he had received it in early
life from an Irishman, who had once lived among the Choctaws
and who had heard the legend from an old Choctaw woman. As
will be seen, the legend was transmitted through several memories
and mouths before being finally recorded in printer's ink.
It came not direct from Choctaw lips, and no doubt, was unconsciously
colored, or its details imperfectly remembered in
its transmission through the memories of the two white men. The
version which is given below came direct from the lips of the
Rev. Peter Folsom, a Choctaw from the nation west, who was
employed in 1882 by the Baptists of Mississippi to labor as a
missionary among the Mississippi Choctaws. Mr. Folsom stated
that soon after finishing his education in Kentucky, one day in
1833, he visited Nanih Waiya with his father and while at the
mound his father related to him the migration legend of his
people, which according to Mr. Folsom, runs as follows:</p>

<p>In ancient days the ancestors of the Choctaws and the
Chickasaws lived in a far western country, under the rule of two
brothers, named Chahta and Chikasa. In process of time, their
population becoming very numerous, they found it difficult to
procure substance in that land. Their prophets thereupon announced
that far to the east was a country of fertile soil and
full of game, where they could live in ease and plenty. The entire
population resolved to make a journey eastward in search of
that happy land. In order more easily to procure subsistence on
their route, the people marched in several divisions of a day's
journey apart. A great prophet marched at their head, bearing
a pole, which, on camping at the close of each day, he planted
erect in the earth, in front of the camp. Every morning the pole
was always seen leaning in the direction they were to travel
that day. After the lapse of many moons, they arrived one day
at Nanih Waiya. The prophet planted his pole at the base of the
mound. The next morning the pole was seen standing erect and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
stationary. This was interpreted as an omen from the Great
Spirit that the long sought-for land was at last found. It so
happened, the very day that the party camped at Nanih Waiya
that a party under Chikasa crossed the creek and camped on its
east side. That night a great rain fell, and it rained several
days. In consequence of this all the low lands were inundated,
and Nanih Waiya Creek and other tributaries of Pearl River
were rendered impassable.</p>

<p>After the subsidence of the waters, messengers were sent
across the creek to bid Chikasa's party return, as the oracular
pole had proclaimed that the long sought-for land was found and
the mound was the center of the land. Chikasa's party, however,
regardless of the weather, had proceeded on their journey, and
the rain having washed all traces of their march from off the
grass, the messengers were unable to follow them up and so returned
to camp. Meanwhile, the other divisions in the rear arrived
at Nanih Waiya, and learned that here was the center of
their new home, their long pilgrimage was at last finished.
Chikasa's party, after their separation from their brethren under
Chahta, moved on to the Tombigbee, and eventually became
a separate nationality. In this way the Choctaws and the Chickasaws
became two separate, though kindred nations.</p>

<p>Such is Mr. Folsom's version of the Choctaw migration
legend. This national legend is now utterly forgotten by the
modern Choctaws living in Mississippi. All, however, look upon
Nanih Waiya as the birthplace and cradle of their race. She is
"ishki chito," "the great mother." In the very center of the
mound, they say, ages ago, the Great Spirit created the first
Choctaws, and through a hole or cave, they crawled forth into
the light of day. Some say that only one pair was created, but
others say that many pairs were created. Old Hopahkitubbe
(Hopakitobi), who died several years ago in Neshoba County,
was wont to say that after coming forth from the mound, the
freshly-made Choctaws were very wet and moist, and that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Great Spirit stacked them along on the rampart, as on a clothes
line, so that the sun could dry them.</p>

<p>Soon after the creation, the Great Spirit divided the Choctaws
into two "iksa," the "Kashapa Okla," and the "Okla in
Holahta," or "Hattak in Holahta." Stationing one iksa on
the north and the other on the west side of the sacred mound,
the Great Spirit then gave them the law of marriage which they
were forever to keep inviolate. This law was that children were
to belong to the iksa of their mother, and that one must always
marry into the opposite iksa. By this law a man belonging to the
Kashapa Okla must marry a woman of the Okla in Holahta. The
children of this marriage belong, of course, to the iksa of their
mother, and whenever they marry it must be into the opposite
iksa. In like manner a man belonging to the Okla in Holahta
must marry a woman of the Kashapa Okla, and the children of
this marriage from Kashapa Okla must marry into the Okla in
Holahta. Such was the Choctaw law of marriage, given, they
say, by Divine authority at Nanih Waiya just after the creation
of their race. The iksa lived promiscuously throughout the nation,
but as every one knew to which iksa he belonged, no matrimonial
mistake could possibly occur. This iksa division of the
Choctaws still exists in Mississippi, but is slowly dying out under
the influence of Christianity, education, and other results of contact
with the white race.</p>

<p>The Choctaws, after their creation lived for a long time
upon the spontaneous productions of the earth until at last
maize was discovered, as they say, on the south side of Bogue
Chito, a few miles distant from Nanih Waiya. There are several
versions of the corn-finding myth, in all of which a crow and a
child are main factors. Some of the versions state particularly
that the crow came from the south, "Oka mahli imma minti tok."
Other versions are silent on this point. The version here given
is a translation by the writer of a version which was written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
down for him in the Choctaw language by Ilaishtubbee (Ilaishtobi),
a Six Towns Indian. It is as follows:</p>

<p>A long time ago it thus happened. In the very beginning a
crow got a single grain of corn from across the great water,
brought it to this country and gave it to an orphan child, who
was playing in the yard. The child named it <i>tauchi</i>, (corn). He
planted it in the yard. When the corn was growing up, the
child's elders merely had it swept around. But the child, wishing
to have his own way, hoed it, hilled it, and laid it by. When this
single grain of corn grew up and matured, it made two ears of
corn. And in this way the ancestors of the Choctaws discovered
corn.</p>

<p>"The great water" referred to in the above myth is the Gulf
of Mexico. "Okachito," "great water," is the term invariably
applied by the Mississippi Choctaws to the Gulf. If there are any
traces of historic truth in the myth, we may infer that it contains
a tradition of the introduction of corn into the Choctaw
country across the Gulf of Mexico, from South America or
from the West Indies. Professor J. W. Harshberger, in his monograph
on the nativity and distribution of maize concludes that
its earliest home was in Central America, whence it spread north
and south over the continents of America. In his map in which
he gives the lines of travel by which maize was distributed, he
has two lines in South America. One of these lines extends southward
between the Andes and the Pacific as far down as Chili.
The second line, after leaving the Isthmus of Panama, goes eastward
along the north coast of South America until it enters Venezuela.
From Venezuela, it goes to the West Indies and from the
West Indies to Florida. This line of maize distribution harmonizes
with the Choctaw tradition embodied in the myth that maize
came into the Choctaw country from across "the great water,"
that is, from across the Gulf of Mexico. We learn from the early
Spanish writers that there was intercommunication between the
natives of Cuba and those of Florida. This being the case, corn
could have been introduced among the pre-historic peoples of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
the Gulf states, across the Gulf, directly or indirectly from
South America. To add completeness to the matter, according to
Professor Harshberger's map, maize was introduced among the
ancient peoples of the States lying north of the Gulf States by
a line of distribution running from northern Mexico. It may be
still further added that maize was certainly introduced into the
Gulf States and into the Mississippi Valley before the beginning
of the mound-building era, for only a sedentary agricultural
people were capable of building the mounds.</p>

<p>Returning from this digression, the question may be asked,
when was Nanih Waiya built, who were its builders, and how
long was it in building? As to the last question, it would be a
moderate estimate to say that it would take two Irishmen, equipped
with spades and wheelbarrows, full ten years of constant
toil to build Nanih Waiya and its rampart. The evidence shows
that the earth used in making the mound was carried at least
one hundred yards&mdash;an additional amount of toil that must be
taken into consideration in making an estimate of the time consumed
in building Nanih Waiya. Furthermore, it can be safely
stated that the two supposed Irishmen could accomplish as much
in one hour in the way of dirt-piling as three pre-historic natives
with their rude tools of wood and stone, and baskets or skins
for carrying the earth, could accomplish in one day. Nanih
Waiya then must have been a long time in building. There must
have been frequent interruptions of work to allow its builders
time to raise crops, or in some manner to procure their supplies
of food. The probabilities are, that while the work of building
the rampart and the towers was carried on continuously until
they were completed, so as to have the people of the place well
protected from their foes, the work of building the mound was
a gradual one. A small or moderate sized mound may first have
been built for the cacique and his attendants. In course of time,
perhaps by his successor, the mound may have been made larger
and higher, each succeeding cacique adding to its size until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
attained its present dimensions. In short, the mound may have
been the successive work of two or three generations.</p>

<p>As to the builders of Nanih Waiya, all the evidence shows
that they were Choctaws. There is no evidence that any race
preceded the Choctaws in the occupancy of Central Mississippi.
And it is not at all probable that the Choctaws would have held
this mound in such excessive reverence if it had been built by an
unknown or alien&middot;race.</p>

<p>During the decadence of the mound-building custom, the
mounds were gradually made smaller and many of these small
mounds reveal relics of European manufacture, thus giving indisputable
evidence of their modern age. From these facts it can
be safely assumed that the larger the mound, the greater, presumably,
is its antiquity. Nanih Waiya then, being the largest
mound in Central Mississippi, may possibly date back to about
fifteen hundred years ago, as the fifth century is given by the
arch&aelig;ologists as the beginning of the mound-building age, which
age lasted about one thousand years. It may be sufficient to say
that Nanih Waiya is very old and was built by the Choctaws
themselves, or possibly, granting it a very remote antiquity, by
the primordial stock, from which, by subsequent differentiation,
the various branches of the Choctaw-Muscogee family were
formed.</p>

<p>In regard to the modern history of the mound, one event
may be placed on record. At some time in 1828, at the instance
by Colonel Greenwood Leflore, a great national council of the
Choctaws convened at Nanih Waiya. The object of this council
was the making of new laws so as to place the Choctaws more in
harmony with the requirements of modern civilization. On this
occasion severe laws were enacted against drunkenness and
against the practice of executing women as witches. This assembly
is remarkable as being the only known national Indian council
held at Nanih Waiya within the historic period. How many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Indian councils similar to this the mound may have witnessed in
the pre-historic past can never be known.</p>

<p>This imperfect sketch of the Choctaw sacred mound is
brought to a close with a hope, that, as long as Mississippi stands,
so long may Nanih Waiya stand, steadfast and immovable, the
greatest of Mississippi's pre-historic monuments.</p>
